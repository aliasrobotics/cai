## Why We Offer CAI PRO

### Sustainability & Quality

Building and maintaining CAI is resource-intensive. CAI PRO enables us to:

#### 1. **Deliver State-of-the-Art AI Without Restrictions**

- **Training Costs**: Developing `alias1` required significant investment in model training, dataset curation, and fine-tuning for cybersecurity tasks
- **Inference Infrastructure**: Hosting a custom 500B-parameter model is expensive—each query requires substantial computational resources
- **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing research, model updates, and performance optimization require dedicated funding

#### 2. **Ensure Project Sustainability**

- **Open Source Commitment**: CAI Community Edition remains free for research, empowering the security community
- **Research Line Funding**: Revenue from PRO subscriptions supports continued academic research and publication
- **European Operations**: Maintaining GDPR-compliant infrastructure in Europe (not cheap US cloud providers) ensures user privacy but increases costs

#### 3. **Provide Professional Support**

- **Dedicated Assistance**: PRO subscribers receive priority technical support from our security experts
- **Custom Extensions**: Work with our team to develop tailored tools and agents for your specific use cases
- **Early Access**: Get new features and models before public release

#### 4. **Privacy & Compliance Guarantees**

- **GDPR Compliance**: Full compliance with European data protection regulations
- **NIS2 Standards**: Meeting network and information security directive requirements
- **Data Sovereignty**: Your data stays in Europe, hosted on our infrastructure
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: Unlike most AI providers, we never share your security testing data

### Fair Pricing

**€350/month** provides:
- **Unlimited `alias1` tokens** (compare: OpenAI GPT-4o costs ~$2.50 per 1M tokens)
- **Professional support** (compare: enterprise support typically $1000+/month)
- **Privacy guarantees** (priceless for security professionals)
- **Commercial license** (required for security consulting businesses)

Most security professionals already pay similar or higher amounts for:
- **Burp Suite Professional**: $449/year ($37/month)
- **ChatGPT Plus/Pro**: $20-200/month (with severe restrictions)
- **Other AI security tools**: $500-2000/month (closed-source, inferior models)

**CAI PRO delivers superior performance at competitive pricing** while keeping your data private and supporting open-source research.
