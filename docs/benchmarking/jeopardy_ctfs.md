## 🏆 alias1 Performance

!!! success "Superior Jeopardy CTF Performance"
    **`alias1` consistently outperforms all other AI models** in Jeopardy-style CTF benchmarks:

    - 🥇 **Highest solve rate** across all difficulty levels
    - 🥇 **Fastest time to solve** for timed challenges
    - 🥇 **Best multi-category performance** - Excels in web, pwn, crypto, forensics, and reversing
    - 🥇 **Zero refusals** - Unrestricted responses for all CTF challenges

    **General-purpose models** (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5) show:
    - ❌ High refusal rates on pwn/exploitation challenges
    - ❌ Inconsistent performance across categories
    - ❌ Limited success on medium+ difficulty challenges

## 🎓 Why Jeopardy CTFs Matter

Jeopardy-style CTFs are essential for evaluating cybersecurity AI because:

1. **Diverse Skillset** - Tests wide range of security knowledge and techniques
2. **Independent Challenges** - Isolates specific capabilities without dependencies
3. **Scalable Difficulty** - From beginner to elite-level challenges
4. **Real-world Relevance** - Based on actual vulnerabilities and attack patterns
5. **Objective Measurement** - Clear success criteria (flag captured or not)

Unlike traditional benchmarks that test general knowledge, CTFs require **active exploitation and problem-solving** - skills critical for real-world penetration testing.
