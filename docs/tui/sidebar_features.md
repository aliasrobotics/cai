# Sidebar Features

> **⚡ CAI-Pro Exclusive Feature**  
> The Terminal User Interface (TUI) is available exclusively in **CAI-Pro**. To access this feature and unlock advanced multi-agent workflows, visit [Alias Robotics](https://aliasrobotics.com) for more information.

---

The CAI TUI sidebar is a powerful vertical panel that provides quick access to essential features and information. It can be toggled on/off to maximize screen space:

- **Toggle button**: Click the sidebar toggle button in the top bar
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press `Ctrl+S` to show/hide the sidebar

When hidden, the sidebar collapses completely, giving you full width for terminal content. Toggle it back to access teams, queue, stats, and API keys.

---

## Overview

The sidebar is organized into four main tabs:

1. **Teams** - Quick team selection for parallel multi-agent workflows
2. **Queue** - Command queue management and execution control
3. **Stats** - Real-time usage statistics and cost tracking
4. **Keys** - API key management and configuration

### Team Tooltips

Hover over any team button to see detailed information:

```
#2: 2 redteam_agent + 2 bug_bounter_agent
T1: redteam_agent
T2: redteam_agent
T3: bug_bounter_agent
T4: bug_bounter_agent
```

**Tooltip features**:
- Color-coded title with team composition
- Terminal-by-terminal agent breakdown
- Visual consistency with TUI color palette

### Using Teams

1. **Click any team button** to instantly configure all four terminals
2. **Automatic synchronization**: Terminal headers update immediately
3. **Preserved context**: Each terminal maintains its conversation history
4. **No disruption**: Switch between teams without losing work

**Example workflow**:

```
1. Start with Team 1 (2 redteam + 2 bug_bounter)
2. Conduct initial vulnerability scan
3. Switch to Team 5 (2 redteam + 2 retester)
4. Validate discovered vulnerabilities
5. Switch to Team 3 (2 redteam + 2 blueteam)
6. Analyze defensive implications
```

## Queue Tab

The **Queue** tab displays commands that are automatically queued when terminals are busy. This tab provides real-time visibility into pending operations.

### Automatic Queuing

Commands are automatically added to the queue when you:
- **Send prompts to busy terminals**: New commands wait while previous ones execute
- **Issue rapid commands**: Quick successive prompts queue automatically
- **Work across terminals**: Commands accumulate independently per terminal

### Queue Display

The queue shows:
- **Pending commands**: Commands waiting to execute
- **Command content**: Full text of each queued prompt
- **Target terminal**: Which terminal will execute the command
- **Execution order**: Commands execute in FIFO (First In, First Out) order
- **Real-time updates**: Queue updates automatically as commands are added or completed

### How It Works

**Automatic execution flow**:
1. You send a prompt to a terminal that's already processing
2. The new prompt is automatically added to that terminal's queue
3. When the current operation completes, the queued prompt executes immediately
4. No manual intervention required

**Visual feedback**:
- **Pending**: Command waiting to execute (displayed in queue)
- **Executing**: Command currently running (queue updates)
- **Completed**: Command finished (removed from queue)

### Monitoring the Queue

Use the Queue tab to:
- **Track pending work**: See what commands are waiting
- **Verify execution order**: Confirm commands will run in the correct sequence
- **Plan workflow**: Know when terminals will be available
- **Avoid conflicts**: Prevent overloading terminals with too many commands

**Example queue display**:

Terminal 2: scan target.com for SQLi vulnerabilities
Terminal 3: analyze authentication mechanisms
Terminal 1: enumerate API endpoints


### Best Practices

✅ **Monitor before sending**: Check the queue before adding more commands to busy terminals

✅ **Use multiple terminals**: Distribute work across terminals to avoid queue buildup

✅ **Wait for completion**: For complex operations, wait until current task finishes before queuing more

## Stats Tab

The **Stats** tab provides real-time monitoring of your CAI usage, costs, and performance metrics.

### Token Usage

**Display metrics**:
- **Input tokens**: Tokens sent to the model
- **Output tokens**: Tokens received from the model
- **Total tokens**: Combined input and output
- **Token rate**: Tokens per request

**Per-terminal breakdown**:

```
Terminal 1: 15,234 tokens
Terminal 2: 8,956 tokens
Terminal 3: 12,445 tokens
Terminal 4: 6,789 tokens
```

### Cost Tracking

**Real-time cost calculation**:
- **Per-terminal costs**: Individual terminal spending
- **Session total**: Combined cost for current session
- **Model-specific rates**: Accurate pricing per model
- **Currency**: Displayed in USD

**Cost breakdown example**:

```
Terminal 1 (alias1): $0.45
Terminal 2 (gpt-5): $0.32
Terminal 3 (alias1): $0.08
Terminal 4 (claude-sonnet-4.5): $0.51

Session Total: $1.36
```

### Request Statistics

**Tracked metrics**:
- **Total requests**: Number of API calls made
- **Successful requests**: Completed without errors
- **Failed requests**: Errors or timeouts
- **Average response time**: Mean latency per request

### Session Information

**Displayed data**:
- **Session duration**: Total time elapsed
- **Active terminals**: Number of terminals in use
- **Current models**: Models assigned to each terminal
- **Active agents**: Agents assigned to each terminal

### Cost Optimization Tips

The Stats tab helps you optimize costs by:
1. **Monitoring usage patterns**: Identify high-cost terminals
2. **Model selection**: Compare costs between models
3. **Token awareness**: Track verbose responses
4. **Budget management**: Set spending limits

## Tips and Best Practices

### Teams

✅ **Use teams for consistent workflows**: Save time by using preconfigured teams instead of manually setting up agents

✅ **Switch teams mid-session**: Change strategies without losing context

✅ **Combine with commands**: Use `/agent` command in specific terminals to fine-tune team configurations

### Queue

✅ **Batch operations**: Queue multiple commands for unattended execution

✅ **Parallel efficiency**: Let multiple terminals work simultaneously

✅ **Strategic ordering**: Order commands to maximize parallelism

### Stats

✅ **Monitor costs regularly**: Keep an eye on spending during long sessions

✅ **Compare models**: Use stats to find the best cost/performance ratio

✅ **Track patterns**: Identify which workflows consume most tokens

### Keys

✅ **Configure on first launch**: Set up all keys before starting work

✅ **Use environment variables**: For production, prefer `.env` over interactive input

## Troubleshooting

### Teams not loading

**Symptom**: Team buttons don't appear or don't respond

**Solutions**:
- Restart the TUI
- Check that team configuration file exists
- Verify agent names are correct


### Stats showing zero

**Symptom**: Token counts and costs display as zero

**Solutions**:
- Execute at least one command to generate stats
- Verify API keys are configured correctly
- Check that model pricing data is loaded

### Keys not saving

**Symptom**: API keys don't persist after restart

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `.env` file has write permissions
- Check for errors in the status bar when saving
- Manually edit `.env` file if interactive method fails
