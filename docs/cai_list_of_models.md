## Model Selection Guide

!!! tip "üìä Based on CAIBench Research"
    Our model recommendations are based on rigorous evaluation using [**CAIBench**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24317), a modular meta-benchmark framework for evaluating LLM models and agents across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains.

    **Research shows:** In [real-world CTF evaluations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17521), defensive agents achieved 54.3% patching success versus 28.3% offensive initial access, with `alias1` consistently outperforming general-purpose models.

### For All Cybersecurity Work

**‚úÖ Always Recommended:** `alias1` (CAI PRO)
- **Best performer** in [CAIBench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24317) evaluations
- **Unrestricted** for authorized pentesting and security research
- **Zero refusals** - designed specifically for offensive security
- **Unlimited tokens** included with CAI PRO subscription
- **Superior CTF performance** - validated in real-world scenarios
- **Beats general-purpose models** (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5) in security tasks

### Alternative Models (Community Edition)

While `alias1` is always recommended for security work, the following models can be used with CAI Community Edition:

#### For Local/Offline Testing

**Alternative:** Ollama with Qwen2.5 72B
- Complete privacy (no data leaves your machine)
- No API costs
- Good for testing and development
- Requires local GPU resources
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Performance significantly below `alias1` for security tasks

#### For Budget-Conscious Users

**Alternative:** DeepSeek V3 or Ollama models
- Lower API costs (DeepSeek)
- Free local inference (Ollama)
- Adequate performance for many tasks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Not optimized for cybersecurity workflows

---

## Additional Integrations

CAI is compatible with multiple model platforms and providers:

- **[OpenRouter](providers/openrouter.md)** - Access to 200+ models via unified API
- **[Ollama](providers/ollama.md)** - Local model hosting and inference
- **[Azure OpenAI](providers/azure.md)** - Enterprise-hosted OpenAI models

See the **Model Providers** section for detailed configuration guides.

## Need Help Choosing?

!!! success "Our Recommendation: Always Use alias1"
    Based on [CAIBench benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24317) and [real-world CTF evaluations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17521), **`alias1` is the superior choice for all cybersecurity tasks**.

    **For any security work:** ‚Üí `alias1` with [CAI PRO](cai_pro.md)

### If CAI PRO is not an option:

- **Privacy-focused?** ‚Üí Ollama local models (lower performance)
- **Budget-conscious?** ‚Üí DeepSeek or Ollama (not optimized for security)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Community models are not optimized for cybersecurity workflows and will have significantly reduced capabilities compared to `alias1`.
