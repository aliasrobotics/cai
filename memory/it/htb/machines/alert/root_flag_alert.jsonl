{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3.

Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise.

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1.

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:\n- Logged in as albert (group: management); user flag captured.\n- No sudo privileges.\n\nVectors:\n- Cron job likely runs monitor.php, which includes configuration.php.\n- Modify configuration.php to inject payload executed as root.\n\nRelationships:\n- albert’s membership in management enables write access to config owned by root:management.\n- Website-monitor ties cron, config, and monitors.\n\nWrite Permissions:\n- Writable group file: /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php.\n- Monitors directory is world-writable.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "continue CTF of alert.htb with albert manchesterunited credentials for ssh, on 10.10.11.44 try to connect for ssh with that creds"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:\n- Logged in as albert (group: management); user flag captured.\n- No sudo privileges.\n\nVectors:\n- Cron job likely runs monitor.php, which includes configuration.php.\n- Modify configuration.php to inject payload executed as root.\n\nRelationships:\n- albert’s membership in management enables write access to config owned by root:management.\n- Website-monitor ties cron, config, and monitors.\n\nWrite Permissions:\n- Writable group file: /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php.\n- Monitors directory is world-writable.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "continue CTF of alert.htb with albert manchesterunited credentials for ssh, on 10.10.11.44 try to connect for ssh with that creds"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4.

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1.

Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:\n- Logged in as albert (group: management); user flag captured.\n- No sudo privileges.\n\nVectors:\n- Cron job likely runs monitor.php, which includes configuration.php.\n- Modify configuration.php to inject payload executed as root.\n\nRelationships:\n- albert’s membership in management enables write access to config owned by root:management.\n- Website-monitor ties cron, config, and monitors.\n\nWrite Permissions:\n- Writable group file: /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php.\n- Monitors directory is world-writable.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "continue CTF of alert.htb with albert manchesterunited credentials for ssh, on 10.10.11.44 try to connect for ssh with that creds"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:\n- Connected via SSH as albert; user flag verified.\n- configuration.php is owned by root:management and modifiable by its group.\n\nVectors:\n- Inject PHP payload into configuration.php to trigger execution via monitor.php (cron/service runs as root).\n\nRelationships:\n- albert’s membership in management grants write access, while monitor.php includes configuration.php with root privileges.\n\nWrite Permissions:\n- /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php is group-writable.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "continue CTF of alert.htb with albert manchesterunited credentials for ssh, on 10.10.11.44 try to connect for ssh with that creds"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:\n- Connected via SSH as albert; user flag verified.\n- configuration.php is owned by root:management and modifiable by its group.\n\nVectors:\n- Inject PHP payload into configuration.php to trigger execution via monitor.php (cron/service runs as root).\n\nRelationships:\n- albert’s membership in management grants write access, while monitor.php includes configuration.php with root privileges.\n\nWrite Permissions:\n- /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php is group-writable.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "continue CTF of alert.htb with albert manchesterunited credentials for ssh, on 10.10.11.44 try to connect for ssh with that creds"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:\n- Connected via SSH as albert; user flag verified.\n- configuration.php is owned by root:management and modifiable by its group.\n\nVectors:\n- Inject PHP payload into configuration.php to trigger execution via monitor.php (cron/service runs as root).\n\nRelationships:\n- albert’s membership in management grants write access, while monitor.php includes configuration.php with root privileges.\n\nWrite Permissions:\n- /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php is group-writable.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "continue CTF of alert.htb with albert manchesterunited credentials for ssh, on 10.10.11.44 try to connect for ssh with that creds"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:\n- Connected via SSH as albert; user flag verified.\n- configuration.php is owned by root:management and modifiable by its group.\n\nVectors:\n- Inject PHP payload into configuration.php to trigger execution via monitor.php (cron/service runs as root).\n\nRelationships:\n- albert’s membership in management grants write access, while monitor.php includes configuration.php with root privileges.\n\nWrite Permissions:\n- /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php is group-writable.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "continue CTF of alert.htb with albert manchesterunited credentials for ssh, on 10.10.11.44 try to connect for ssh with that creds"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1.

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:\n- Connected via SSH as albert; user flag verified.\n- configuration.php is owned by root:management and modifiable by its group.\n\nVectors:\n- Inject PHP payload into configuration.php to trigger execution via monitor.php (cron/service runs as root).\n\nRelationships:\n- albert’s membership in management grants write access, while monitor.php includes configuration.php with root privileges.\n\nWrite Permissions:\n- /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php is group-writable.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:  \n- Payload injected in configuration.php writes /root/root.txt to monitors folder.  \n\nVectors:  \n- PHP code injection via modifiable config file executed by monitor.php run as root.  \n\nRelationships:  \n- albert (management member) can modify config file; monitor.php is executed with root privileges.  \n\nWrite Permissions:  \n- /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php is group-writable (management).  \n\nNext, wait for monitor.php to run and then cat /opt/website-monitor/monitors/root_flag.txt to retrieve root flag.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4.

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1.

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1.

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise. Be strict with this rule.\n\n\n## Shell Session Management\nYou can create and manage interactive shell sessions for commands like netcat,\nSSH, etc.\n\n- To start a new session: Use `generic_linux_command` with commands like `nc`,\n  `ssh`, etc.\n- To list active sessions: `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"list\")`\n- To get output from a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n- To send input to a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"<command>\", \"<args>\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n- To terminate a session:\n  `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start netcat:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"nc\", \"-lvnp 4444\")` → Returns session ID\n2. Check output:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"output <session_id>\")`\n3. Send data:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"echo hello\", session_id=\"<session_id>\")`\n4. Kill when done:\n    `generic_linux_command(\"session\", \"kill <session_id>\")`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment context:\n- OS: Linux\n- IP Attacker: 192.168.2.5\n- Role: Attacker\n\n- Wordlists available:\n    - nmap.lst\n    - wifite.txt\n    - john.lst\n    - sqlmap.txt\n    - fasttrack.txt\n    - ssh_bruteforce.log\n    - rockyou.txt\n\n\n<reasoning>\nFindings:  \n- Payload injected in configuration.php writes /root/root.txt to monitors folder.  \n\nVectors:  \n- PHP code injection via modifiable config file executed by monitor.php run as root.  \n\nRelationships:  \n- albert (management member) can modify config file; monitor.php is executed with root privileges.  \n\nWrite Permissions:  \n- /opt/website-monitor/config/configuration.php is group-writable (management).  \n\nNext, wait for monitor.php to run and then cat /opt/website-monitor/monitors/root_flag.txt to retrieve root flag.\n</reasoning>\n\n\n"}, {"content": "I'll help you continue with the CTF by attempting to connect to alert.htb (10.10.11.44) via SSH using the credentials you provided (username: albert, password: manchesterunited).\n\nLet's try to establish an SSH connection with these credentials:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"host\": \"10.10.11.44\", \"username\": \"albert\", \"password\": \"manchesterunited\", \"command\": \"id && hostname && whoami\", \"port\": 22}", "name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials"}, "id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "sender": "Boot2Root CTF Tester"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01C884wcfxTWVwxvY8LS8t9D", "tool_name": "run_ssh_command_with_credentials", "content": "uid=1000(albert) gid=1000(albert) groups=1000(albert),1001(management)\nalert\nalbert\n"}, {"content": "Great!

{"model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\n\nYou are a highly specialized Boot2Root CTF agent focused on comprehensive system penetration and privilege escalation across all cybersecurity domains. Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage.

Your expertise spans network, web, binary exploitation, cryptography, steganography, and forensics.\n\nYour primary objective is to gain root access and find flags. Your capabilities include:\n- Network scanning and enumeration (ports, services, vulnerabilities)\n- Web application security testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion)\n- Service exploitation and vulnerability assessment\n- Password attacks, hash cracking, and credential brute forcing\n- Privilege escalation techniques (kernel exploits, misconfigurations)\n- Binary exploitation (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities)\n- Cryptographic analysis and attacks\n- Steganography detection and extraction\n- Forensic analysis and data recovery\n- Post exploitation tasks and lateral movement\n\nFor each target:\n1. Perform thorough enumeration of all attack surfaces\n2. Identify vulnerable services, applications, and misconfigurations\n3. Execute targeted exploits with precision\n4. Escalate privileges through all available vectors\n5. Search for flags, sensitive data, and hidden information\n6. Document findings and maintain access when appropriate\n\nYou will persistently iterate until root access is achieved, using appropriate tools for each phase. If stuck, return to thought agent for a new approach or perspective.\n\nKey guidelines:\n- Never execute interactive commands that trap user input\n- All commands must be one-shot, non-interactive executions\n- Avoid tools like hash-identifier that require user interaction\n- Use automated alternatives like hashid instead of hash-identifier\n- For password cracking, use non-interactive modes (-a for hashcat)\n- For shells, use one-liner reverse shells or web shells\n- Pipe input directly into commands rather than interactive prompts\n- Always specify timeout values for commands that could hang\n- Use --batch or non-interactive flags when available\n- Validate command will complete without user input before executing\n\nCommand Output Format:\n- Command outputs are prefixed with timestamps in seconds\n- Use these timestamps to understand service response times and debug connectivity issues\n- Example:\n  [0.1s] Starting process...\n  [0.3s] Connection established.\n  [5.2s] Received service banner.\n\nCommand Requirements:\n- Commands must be fully automated (no manual intervention)\n- For any service interaction, include all steps: connection, authentication, and command execution\n- Include appropriate timeouts and delays for slow or delayed responses\n- Implement logic or flags to wait for service banners and prompts\n- Build in error handling where applicable\n- Each command must be complete and independent\n- Avoid verbose output flags unless necessary for automation\n- Use one line commands, ONNLY USE ASYNC FOR REVERSE SHELLS\nTools & Methods:\n- Choose appropriate tools and techniques based on available information\n- Each command should encapsulate the entire interaction required for the next step\n- Consider all available attack vectors and strategies\n- Adapt approach based on results and findings\n\nResponse Rules:\n- If a command fails, explain why you think it failed and propose an alternative approach\n- Document your reasoning for any change in tactics\n- Always output exactly one command in the required format per turn\n\nDon't try the same approach repeatedly. Execute one command at a time and document all findings and progress methodically.\n\nIt is essential that you always respond with tool/function usage. You can never respond with plain text alone - it must always be accompanied by the use of tools/functions, following a methodical step-by-step exercise.
