+
+This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
+published from being rewound.
+
+The workflow assumed here is:
+
+ * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
+   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
+
+ * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
+   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
+   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
+   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
+   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
+
+ * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
+   branches, merge them into "next" branch.
+
+The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
+to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
+$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
+
+With this workflow, you would want to know:
+
+(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
+    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
+    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
+    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
+    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
+    not want to rewind it.
+
+(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
+    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
+    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
+    change things related to the topic as patches against your
+    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
+    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
+    tip of "master".
+
+Let's look at this example:
+
+		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
+		  /       /           /           /
+		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
+		/   /               /           /
+	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
+	      /   /   /             \         /
+	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
+	    /   /   /   /             \     /
+    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
+
+
+A, B and C are topic branches.
+
+ * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
+
+ * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
+   and is ready to be deleted.
+
+ * C has not merged to "next" at all.
+
+We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
+B to be deleted.
+
+To compute (1):
+
+	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
+	git rev-list ^master        next
+
+	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
+
+To compute (2):
+
+	git rev-list master..topic
+
+	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

+# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
+# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to

+## Motivation
+### :bust_in_silhouette: Why CAI?
+The cybersecurity landscape is undergoing a dramatic transformation as AI becomes increasingly integrated into security operations. **We predict that by 2028, AI-powered security testing tools will outnumber human pentesters**. This shift represents a fundamental change in how we approach cybersecurity challenges. *AI is not just another tool - it's becoming essential for addressing complex security vulnerabilities and staying ahead of sophisticated threats. As organizations face more advanced cyber attacks, AI-enhanced security testing will be crucial for maintaining robust defenses.*
+
+This work builds upon prior efforts[^4] and similarly, we believe that democratizing access to advanced cybersecurity AI tools is vital for the entire security community. That's why we're releasing Cybersecurity AI (`CAI`) as an open source framework. Our goal is to empower security researchers, ethical hackers, and organizations to build and deploy powerful AI-driven security tools. By making these capabilities openly available, we aim to level the playing field and ensure that cutting-edge security AI technology isn't limited to well-funded private companies or state actors.
+
+Bug Bounty programs have become a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, providing a crucial mechanism for organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities in their systems before they can be exploited. These programs have proven highly effective at securing both public and private infrastructure, with researchers discovering critical vulnerabilities that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. CAI is specifically designed to enhance these efforts by providing a lightweight, ergonomic framework for building specialized AI agents that can assist in various aspects of Bug Bounty hunting - from initial reconnaissance to vulnerability validation and reporting. Our framework aims to augment human expertise with AI capabilities, helping researchers work more efficiently and thoroughly in their quest to make digital systems more secure.
+
+### Ethical principles behind CAI
+
+You might be wondering if releasing CAI *in-the-wild* given its capabilities and security implications is ethical. Our decision to open-source this framework is guided by two core ethical principles:
+
+1. **Democratizing Cybersecurity AI**: We believe that advanced cybersecurity AI tools should be accessible to the entire security community, not just well-funded private companies or state actors. By releasing CAI as an open source framework, we aim to empower security researchers, ethical hackers, and organizations to build and deploy powerful AI-driven security tools, leveling the playing field in cybersecurity.
+
+2. **Transparency in AI Security Capabilities**: Based on our research results, understanding of the technology, and dissection of top technical reports, we argue that current LLM vendors are undermining their cybersecurity capabilities. This is extremely dangerous and misleading. By developing CAI openly, we provide a transparent benchmark of what AI systems can actually do in cybersecurity contexts, enabling more informed decisions about security postures.
+
+CAI is built on the following core principles:
+- **Cybersecurity oriented AI framework**: CAI is specifically designed for cybersecurity use cases, aiming at semi- and fully-automating offensive and defensive security tasks.
+- **Open source, free for research**: CAI is open source and free for research purposes. We aim at democratizing access to AI and Cybersecurity. For professional or commercial use, including on-premise deployments, dedicated technical support and custom extensions [reach out](mailto:research@aliasrobotics.com) to obtain a license.
+- **Lightweight**: CAI is designed to be fast, and easy to use.
+- **Modular and agent-centric design**: CAI operates on the basis of agents and agentic patterns, which allows flexibility and scalability. You can easily add the most suitable agents and pattern for your cybersecuritytarget case.
+- **Tool-integration**: CAI integrates already built-in tools, and allows the user to integrate their own tools with their own logic easily.
+- **Logging and tracing integrated**: using [`phoenix`](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix), the open source tracing and logging tool for LLMs. This provides the user with a detailed traceability of the agents and their execution.
+- **Multi-Model Support**: more than 300 supported and empowered by [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm). The most popular providers:
+  - **Anthropic**: `Claude 3.7`, `Claude 3.5`, `Claude 3`, `Claude 3 Opus`
+  - **OpenAI**: `O1`, `O1 Mini`, `O3 Mini`, `GPT-4o`, `GPT-4.5 Preview`
+  - **DeepSeek**: `DeepSeek V3`, `DeepSeek R1`
+  - **Ollama**: `Qwen2.5 72B`, `Qwen2.5 14B`, etc

+
+### :nut_and_bolt: Setup `.env` file
+
+CAI leverages the `.env` file to load configuration at launch. To facilitate the setup, the repo provides an exemplary [`.env.example`](.env.example) file provides a template for configuring CAI's setup and your LLM API keys to work with desired LLM models.
+
+:warning: Important:
+
+CAI does NOT provide API keys for any model by default. Don't ask us to provide keys, use your own or host your own models.
+
+
+:warning: Note:
+
+The OPENAI_API_KEY must not be left blank. It should contain either "sk-123" (as a placeholder) or your actual API key. See https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/issues/27.
+
+
+## :triangular_ruler: Architecture:
+
+CAI focuses on making cybersecurity agent **coordination** and **execution** lightweight, highly controllable, and useful for humans. To do so it builds upon 7 pillars: `Agent`s, `Tools`, `Handoffs`, `Patterns`, `Turns`, `Tracing` and `HITL`.

+
+
+### 🔹 Agent
+
+At its core, CAI abstracts its cybersecurity behavior via `Agents` and agentic `Patterns`. An Agent in *an intelligent system that interacts with some environment*. More technically, within CAI we embrace a robotics-centric definition wherein an agent is anything that can be viewed as a system perceiving its environment through sensors, reasoning about its goals and and acting accordingly upon that environment through actuators (*adapted* from Russel & Norvig, AI: A Modern Approach). In cybersecurity, an `Agent` interacts with systems and networks, using peripherals and network interfaces as sensors, reasons accordingly and then executes network actions as if actuators. Correspondingly, in CAI, `Agent`s implement the `ReACT` (Reasoning and Action) agent model[^3].
+
+
+```python
+from cai.types import Agent
+from cai.core import CAI
+ctf_agent = Agent(
+    name="CTF Agent",
+    instructions="""You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader""",
+    model= "gpt-4o",
+)
+
+messages = [{
+    "role": "user",
+    "content": "CTF challenge: TryMyNetwork. Target IP: 192.168.1.1"
+   }]
+
+client = CAI()
+response = client.run(agent=ctf_agent,
+                      messages=messages)
+```
+
+### 🔹 Tools
+
+`Tools` let cybersecurity agents take actions by providing interfaces to execute system commands, run security scans, analyze vulnerabilities, and interact with target systems and APIs - they are the core capabilities that enable CAI agents to perform security tasks effectively; in CAI, tools include built-in cybersecurity utilities (like LinuxCmd for command execution, WebSearch for OSINT gathering, Code for dynamic script execution, and SSHTunnel for secure remote access), function calling mechanisms that allow integration of any Python function as a security tool, and agent-as-tool functionality that enables specialized security agents (such as reconnaissance or exploit agents) to be used by other agents, creating powerful collaborative security workflows without requiring formal handoffs between agents.
+
+```python
+from cai.types import Agent
+from cai.tools.common import run_command
+from cai.core import CAI
+
+def listing_tool():
+   """
+   This is a tool used list the files in the current directory
+   """
+    command = "ls -la"
+    return run_command(command, ctf=ctf)
+
+def generic_linux_command(command: str = "", args: str = "", ctf=None) -> str:
+    """
+    Tool to send a linux command.
+    """
+    command = f'{command} {args}'
+    return run_command(command, ctf=ctf)
+
+ctf_agent = Agent(
+    name="CTF Agent",
+    instructions="""You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader""",
+    model= "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
+    functions=[listing_tool, generic_linux_command])
+
+client = CAI()
+messages = [{
+    "role": "user",
+    "content": "CTF challenge: TryMyNetwork. Target IP: 192.168.1.1"
+   }]
+
+response = client.run(agent=ctf_agent,
+                      messages=messages)
+```
+
+
+You may find different [tools](cai/tools). They are grouped in 6 major categories inspired by the security kill chain [^2]:
+
+1. Reconnaissance and weaponization - *reconnaissance*  (crypto, listing, etc)
+2. Exploitation - *exploitation*
+3. Privilege escalation - *escalation*
+4. Lateral movement - *lateral*
+5. Data exfiltration - *exfiltration*
+6. Command and control - *control*
+
+
+### 🔹 Handoffs
+
+`Handoffs` allow an `Agent` to delegate tasks to another agent, which is crucial in cybersecurity operations where specialized expertise is needed for different phases of an engagement. In our framework, `Handoffs` are implemented as tools for the LLM, where a **handoff/transfer function** like `transfer_to_flag_discriminator` enables the `ctf_agent` to pass control to the `flag_discriminator_agent` once it believes it has found the flag. This creates a security validation chain where the first agent handles exploitation and flag discovery, while the second agent specializes in flag verification, ensuring proper segregation of duties and leveraging specialized capabilities of different models for distinct security tasks.
+
+
+```python
+from cai.types import Agent
+from cai.core import CAI
+
+ctf_agent = Agent(
+    name="CTF Agent",
+    instructions="""You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader""",
+    model= "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
+    functions=[],
+)
+
+flag_discriminator_agent = Agent(
+    name="Flag Discriminator Agent",
+    instructions="You are a Cybersecurity expert facing a CTF challenge. You are in charge of checking if the flag is correct.",
+    model= "qwen2.5:14b",
+    functions=[],
+)
+
+def transfer_to_flag_discriminator():
+    """
+    Transfer the flag to the flag_discriminator_agent to check if it is the correct flag
+    """
+    return flag_discriminator_agent
+
+ctf_agent.functions.append(transfer_to_flag_discriminator)
+
+client = CAI()
+messages = [{
+    "role": "user",
+    "content": "CTF challenge: TryMyNetwork. Target IP: 192.168.1.1"
+   }]
+
+response = client.run(agent=ctf_agent,
+                      messages=messages)
+```
+
+### 🔹 Patterns
+
+An agentic `Pattern` is a *structured design paradigm* in artificial intelligence systems where autonomous or semi-autonomous agents operate within a defined *interaction framework* (the pattern) to achieve a goal. These `Patterns` specify the organization, coordination, and communication
+methods among agents, guiding decision-making, task execution, and delegation.
+
+An agentic pattern (`AP`) can be formally defined as a tuple:
+
+\\[
+AP = (A, H, D, C, E)
+\\]
+
+wherein:
+
+- **\\(A\\) (Agents):** A set of autonomous entities, \\( A = \\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\} \\), each with defined roles, capabilities, and internal states.
+- **\\(H\\) (Handoffs):** A function \\( H: A \times T \to A \\) that governs how tasks \\( T \\) are transferred between agents based on predefined logic (e.g., rules, negotiation, bidding).
+- **\\(D\\) (Decision Mechanism):** A decision function \\( D: S \to A \\) where \\( S \\) represents system states, and \\( D \\) determines which agent takes action at any given time.
+- **\\(C\\) (Communication Protocol):** A messaging function \\( C: A \times A \to M \\), where \\( M \\) is a message space, defining how agents share information.
+- **\\(E\\) (Execution Model):** A function \\( E: A \times I \to O \\) where \\( I \\) is the input space and \\( O \\) is the output space, defining how agents perform tasks.
+
+When building `Patterns`, we generall y classify them among one of the following categories, though others exist:
+
+| **Agentic** `Pattern` **categories** | **Description** |
+|--------------------|------------------------|
+| `Swarm` (Decentralized) | Agents share tasks and self-assign responsibilities without a central orchestrator. Handoffs occur dynamically. *An example of a peer-to-peer agentic pattern is the `CTF Agentic Pattern`, which involves a team of agents working together to solve a CTF challenge with dynamic handoffs.* |
+| `Hierarchical` | A top-level agent (e.g., "PlannerAgent") assigns tasks via structured handoffs to specialized sub-agents. Alternatively, the structure of the agents is harcoded into the agentic pattern with pre-defined handoffs. |
+| `Chain-of-Thought` (Sequential Workflow) | A structured pipeline where Agent A produces an output, hands it to Agent B for reuse or refinement, and so on. Handoffs follow a linear sequence. *An example of a chain-of-thought agentic pattern is the `ReasonerAgent`, which involves a Reasoning-type LLM that provides context to the main agent to solve a CTF challenge with a linear sequence.*[^1] |
+| `Auction-Based` (Competitive Allocation) | Agents "bid" on tasks based on priority, capability, or cost. A decision agent evaluates bids and hands off tasks to the best-fit agent. |
+| `Recursive` | A single agent continuously refines its own output, treating itself as both executor and evaluator, with handoffs (internal or external) to itself. *An example of a recursive agentic pattern is the `CodeAgent` (when used as a recursive agent), which continuously refines its own output by executing code and updating its own instructions.* |
+
+Building a `Pattern` is rather straightforward and only requires to link together `Agents`, `Tools` and `Handoffs`. For example, the following builds an offensive `Pattern` that adopts the `Swarm` category:
+
+```python
+# A Swarm Pattern for Red Team Operations
+from cai.agents.red_teamer import redteam_agent
+from cai.agents.thought import thought_agent
+from cai.agents.mail import dns_smtp_agent
+
+
+def transfer_to_dns_agent():
+    """
+    Use THIS always for DNS scans and domain reconnaissance about dmarc and dkim registers
+    """
+    return dns_smtp_agent
+
+
+def redteam_agent_handoff(ctf=None):
+    """
+    Red Team Agent, call this function empty to transfer to redteam_agent
+    """
+    return redteam_agent
+
+
+def thought_agent_handoff(ctf=None):
+    """
+    Thought Agent, call this function empty to transfer to thought_agent
+    """
+    return thought_agent
+
+# Register handoff functions to enable inter-agent communication pathways
+redteam_agent.functions.append(transfer_to_dns_agent)
+dns_smtp_agent.functions.append(redteam_agent_handoff)
+thought_agent.functions.append(redteam_agent_handoff)
+
+# Initialize the swarm pattern with the thought agent as the entry point
+redteam_swarm_pattern = thought_agent
+redteam_swarm_pattern.pattern = "swarm"
+```
+
+### 🔹 Turns and Interactions
+During the agentic flow (conversation), we distinguish between **interactions** and **turns**.
+
+- **Interactions** are sequential exchanges between one or multiple agents. Each agent executing its logic corresponds with one *interaction*. Since an `Agent` in CAI generally implements the `ReACT` agent model[^3], each *interaction* consists of 1) a reasoning step via an LLM inference and 2) act by calling zero-to-n `Tools`. This is defined in`process_interaction()` in [core.py](cai/core.py).
+- **Turns**: A turn represents a cycle of one ore more **interactions** which finishes when the `Agent` (or `Pattern`) executing returns `None`, judging there're no further actions to undertake. This is defined in `run()`, see [core.py](cai/core.py).
+
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> CAI Agents are not related to Assistants in the Assistants API. They are named similarly for convenience, but are otherwise completely unrelated. CAI is entirely powered by the Chat Completions API and is hence stateless between calls.
+
+
+### 🔹 Tracing
+
+CAI implements AI observability by adopting the OpenTelemetry standard and to do so, it leverages [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) which provides comprehensive tracing capabilities through OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation, allowing you to monitor and analyze your security operations in real-time. This integration enables detailed visibility into agent interactions, tool usage, and attack vectors throughout penetration testing workflows, making it easier to debug complex exploitation chains, track vulnerability discovery processes, and optimize agent performance for more effective security assessments.

+CAI delivers a framework for building Cybersecurity AIs with a strong emphasis on *semi-autonomous* operation, as the reality is that **fully-autonomous** cybersecurity systems remain premature and face significant challenges when tackling complex tasks. While CAI explores autonomous capabilities, we recognize that effective security operations still require human teleoperation providing expertise, judgment, and oversight in the security process.
+
+Accordingly, the Human-In-The-Loop (`HITL`) module is a core design principle of CAI, acknowledging that human intervention and teleoperation are essential components of responsible security testing. Through the `cli.py` interface, users can seamlessly interact with agents at any point during execution by simply pressing `Ctrl+C`. This is implemented across [core.py](cai/core.py) and also in the REPL abstractions [REPL](cai/repl).
+
+
+## :rocket: Quickstart
+
+
+To start CAI after installing it, just type `cai` in the CLI:

+### :information_source: Usage Data Collection
+
+CAI is provided free of charge for researchers. Instead of payment for research use cases, we ask you to contribute to the CAI community by allowing usage data collection. This data helps us understand how the framework is being used, identify areas for improvement, and prioritize new features. The collected data includes:
+
+- Basic system information (OS type, Python version)
+- Username and IP information
+- Tool usage patterns and performance metrics
+- Model interactions and token usage statistics
+
+This data helps us understand how CAI is used, identify bugs, and improve performance. **All data collection is opt-in by default**, but you can opt out by setting the environment variable:
+
+```bash
+export CAI_TELEMETRY=false
+```
+
+We take your privacy seriously and only collect what's needed to make CAI better.
+
+### Reproduce CI-Setup locally
+
+To simulate the CI/CD pipeline, you can run the following in the Gitlab runner machines:
+
+```bash
+docker run --rm -it \
+  --privileged \
+  --network=exploitflow_net \
+  --add-host="host.docker.internal:host-gateway" \

+<summary>Run CAI against any target</summary>
+
+![cai-004-first-message](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-004-first-message.png)
+
+The starting user prompt in this case is: `Target IP: 192.168.2.10, perform a full network scan`.
+
+The agent started performing a nmap scan. You could either interact with the agent and give it more instructions, or let it run to see what it explores next.

+<details>
+<summary>How do I interact with the agent? Type twice CTRL + C </summary>
+
+![cai-005-ctrl-c](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-005-ctrl-c.png)
+
+If you want to use the HITL mode, you can do it by presssing twice ```Ctrl + C```.
+This will allow you to interact (prompt) with the agent whenever you want. The agent will not lose the previous context, as it is stored in the `history` variable, which is passed to it and any agent that is called. This enables any agent to use the previous information and be more accurate and efficient.

+<summary>How can I trace the whole execution?</summary>
+The environment variable `CAI_TRACING` allows the user to set it to `CAI_TRACING=true` to enable tracing, or `CAI_TRACING=false` to disable it.
+When CAI is prompted by the first time, the user is provided with two paths, the execution log, and the tracing log.
+
+![cai-009-logs](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-009-logs.png)
+
+</details>
+
+
+<details>
+<summary>Can I expand CAI capabilities using previous run logs?</summary>
+
+Absolutely! The **memory extension** allows you to use a previously sucessful runs ( the log object is stored as a **.jsonl file in the [log](cai/logs) folder** ) in a new run against the same target.
+The user is also given the path highlighted in orange as shown below.
+
+![cai-009-logs](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-009-logs.png)
+
+How to make use of this functionality?
+
+1. Run CAI against the target. Let's assume the target name is: `target001`.
+2. Get the log file path, something like: ```logs/cai_20250408_111856.jsonl```
+3. Generate the memory using any model of your preference:
+```shell JSONL_FILE_PATH="logs/cai_20250408_111856.jsonl" CTF_INSIDE="false" CAI_MEMORY_COLLECTION="target001" CAI_MEMORY="episodic" CAI_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" python3 tools/2_jsonl_to_memory.py ```
+
+The script [`tools/2_jsonl_to_memory.py`](cai/tools/2_jsonl_to_memory.py) will generate a memory collection file with the most relevant steps. The quality of the memory collection will depend on the model you use.
+
+4. Use the generated memory collection and execute a new run:
+```shell CAI_MEMORY="episodic" CAI_MODEL="gpt-4o" CAI_MEMORY_COLLECTION="target001" CAI_TRACING=false python3 cai/cli.py```
+
+</details>
+
+<details>
+<summary>Can I expand CAI capabilities using scripts or extra information?</summary>
+
+Currently, CAI supports text based information. You can add any extra information on the target you are facing by copy-pasting it directly into the system or user prompt.
+
+**How?** By adding it to the system ([`system_master_template.md`](cai/repl/templates/system_master_template.md)) or the user prompt ([`user_master_template.md`](cai/repl/templates/user_master_template.md)). You can always directly prompt the path to the model, and it will ```cat``` it.

+# Airline customer service
+
+This example demonstrates a multi-agent setup for handling different customer service requests in an airline context using the CAI framework. The agents can triage requests, handle flight modifications, cancellations, and lost baggage cases.
+This example uses the helper function `run_cai_cli`, which allows us to create an interactive CAI session.
+
+## Agents
+
+1. **Triage Agent**: Determines the type of request and transfers to the appropriate agent.
+2. **Flight Modification Agent**: Handles requests related to flight modifications, further triaging them into:
+   - **Flight Cancel Agent**: Manages flight cancellation requests.
+   - **Flight Change Agent**: Manages flight change requests.
+3. **Lost Baggage Agent**: Handles lost baggage inquiries.
+
+## Setup
+
+Once you have installed dependencies and CAI, run the example using:
+
+```shell
+python3 main.py
+```
+
+## Evaluations
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.
+
+For this example, we run function evals, where we input a conversation, and the expected function call ('None' if no function call is expected).
+The evaluation cases are stored in `eval/eval_cases/` subfolder.
+
+```json
+[
+  {
+    "conversation": [
+      { "role": "user", "content": "My bag was not delivered!" }
+    ],
+    "function": "transfer_to_lost_baggage"
+  },
+  {
+    "conversation": [
+      { "role": "user", "content": "I had some turbulence on my flight" }
+    ],
+    "function": "None"
+  }
+]
+```
+
+The script 'function_evals.py' will run the evals. Make sure to set `n` to the number
+of times you want to run each particular eval. To run the script from the root airline folder, execute:
+
+```bash
+cd evals
+python3 function_evals.py
+```
+
+The results of these evaluations will be stored in `evals/eval_results/`

+# CAI basic
+
+This folder contains basic examples demonstrating core CAI capabilities. These examples show the simplest implementations of CAI, with one input message, and a corresponding output. The `simple_loop_no_helpers` has a while loop to demonstrate how to create an interactive CAI session.
+
+### Examples
+
+1. **agent_handoff.py**
+
+   - Demonstrates how to transfer a conversation from one agent to another.
+   - **Usage**: Transfers Spanish-speaking users from an English agent to a Spanish agent.
+
+2. **bare_minimum.py**
+
+   - A bare minimum example showing the basic setup of an agent.
+   - **Usage**: Sets up an agent that responds to a simple user message.
+
+3. **context_variables.py**
+
+   - Shows how to use context variables within an agent.
+   - **Usage**: Uses context variables to greet a user by name and print account details.
+
+4. **function_calling.py**
+
+   - Demonstrates how to define and call functions from an agent.
+   - **Usage**: Sets up an agent that can respond with weather information for a given location.
+
+5. **simple_loop_no_helpers.py**
+   - An example of a simple interaction loop without using helper functions.
+   - **Usage**: Sets up a loop where the user can continuously interact with the agent, printing the conversation.
+
+## Running the Examples
+
+To run any of the examples, use the following command:
+
+```shell
+python3 <example_name>.py
+```

+You are a planner for the Swarm framework.
+Your job is to create a properly formatted JSON plan step by step, to satisfy the task given.
+Create a list of subtasks based off the [TASK] provided. Your FIRST THOUGHT should be, do I need to call a tool here to answer
+or fulfill the user's request. First, think through the steps of the plan necessary. Make sure to carefully look over the tools you are given access to to decide this.
+If you are confident that you do not need a tool to respond, either just in conversation or to ask for clarification or more information, respond to the prompt in a concise, but conversational, tone in double quotes. Do not explain that you do not need a tool.
+If you DO need tools, create a list of subtasks. Each subtask must be from within the [AVAILABLE TOOLS] list. DO NOT use any tools that are not in the list.
+Make sure you have all information needed to call the tools you use in your plan.
+Base your decisions on which tools to use from the description and the name and arguments of the tool.
+Always output the arguments of the tool, even when arguments is an empty dictionary. MAKE SURE YOU USE ALL REQUIRED ARGUMENTS.
+The plan should be as short as possible.

New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/answers> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/answers>\n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Answers endpoint:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524217540/51eda23e171f33f1b9d5acff/rM6ZVI3XZ2CpxcEStmG5mFy6ATBCskmX2g3_GPmeY3FicvrWfJCuFOtzsnbkpMQe-TQ6hi5j1BV9cFo7bCDcsz8VWxFfeOnC1Gb4QNaeVYtJq4Qtg76SBOLLk-jgHUA8mWZ0QgOuV636UgcvMA)All of these options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints)\n\n\n\nOption 1: Transition to Embeddings-based search (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving the underlying search system to use a vector-based embedding search. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our embeddings system has much more contextual awareness. Also, in general, using embeddings will be considerably lower cost in the long run. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using a small dataset (<10,000 documents), consider using the techniques described in that guide to find the best documents to construct a prompt similar to [this](#h_89196129b2). Then, you can just submit that prompt to our [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset, consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/beyond_search_openai/src/server.py) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to recreate the functionality of the Answers endpoint, here\u2019s how we did it. There is also a [script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/answers_functionality_example.py) that replicates most of this functionality.\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are two main ways you can use the answers endpoint: you can source the data from an uploaded file or send it in with the request.\n\n\n\n**If you\u2019re using the document parameter**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one step if you provide the documents in the Answers API call.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used: \n\n\n* Construct the prompt [with this format.](#h_89196129b2)\n* Gather all of the provided documents. If they fit in the prompt, just use all of them.\n* Do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) (note that this is also being deprecated and has a [transition guide](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/dgkjq2bp/articles/articles/6272952/show)) where the documents are the user provided documents and the query is the query from above. Rank the documents by score.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the context.\n* Request a completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc)\n\n\nThroughout all of this, you\u2019ll need to check that the prompt\u2019s length doesn\u2019t exceed [the model's token limit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/gpt-3). To assess the number of tokens present in a prompt, we recommend <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast>. \n\n\n\nIf you're using the file parameter\n----------------------------------\n\n\nStep 1: upload a jsonl file\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, we upload new files meant for answers to an Elastic search cluster. Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nIf you uploaded the file with the purpose \u201canswers,\u201d we additionally split the documents on newlines and upload each of those chunks as separate documents to ensure that we can search across and reference the highest number of relevant text sections in the file.\n\n\n\nEach line requires a \u201ctext\u201d field and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field.\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_rerank` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used. Our end goal is to create a [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) request [with this format](#h_89196129b2). It will look very similar to [Documents](#h_cb1d8a8d3f)\n\n\n\nFrom there, our steps are: \n\n\n* Start with the `experimental\\_alternative\\_question` or, if that's not provided, what\u2019s in the `question` field. Call that the query.\n* Query Elastic search for `max\\_rerank` documents with query as the search param.\n* Take those documents and do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) on them where the entries from Elastic search are the docs, and the query is the query that you used above. Use the score from the search to rank the documents.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the prompt.\n* Request an OpenAI completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc). Return that answer to the user.\n\n\nCompletion Prompt\n-----------------\n\n\n\n```\n===  \nContext: #{{ provided examples_context }}  \n===  \nQ: example 1 question  \nA: example 1 answer  \n---  \nQ: example 2 question  \nA: example 2 answer  \n(and so on for all examples provided in the request)   \n===  \nContext: #{{ what we return from Elasticsearch }}  \n===  \nQ: #{{ user provided question }}   \nA:\n```\n", "title": "Answers Transition Guide", "article_id": "6233728", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6233728-answers-transition-guide"}

There are a couple caveats of which to be mindful:\n\n\n* Email addresses: **You'll need to use a new email address**.\n\n\n\t+ Since every email address is unique per account, we require a different email address for new accounts. If you don't have an alternative email address, you can try using what's known as an email subaddress: instead of [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com), try [jane+alt@example.com](mailto:jane+alt@example.com). Emails to this address should still go to the same inbox (everything after the + is typically ignored by your email provider), but we'll treat this as a unique email address.\n* Phone numbers: New accounts are still subject to our limit of [3 accounts per phone number](https://help.openai.com/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq#h_de13bb96c0). Deleted accounts also count toward this limit. Deleting an account does not free up another spot. A phone number can only ever be used up to 3 times for verification to generate the first API key for your account on platform.openai.com.\n\n\n\t+ Phone verification is **not** required to create an OpenAI account.\n\t+ Phone verification is required for a new account to generate their first API key on platform.openai.com.\n\n**We don't support unlinking a phone number from an existing account**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do not allow you to unlink phone numbers from existing accounts.\n\n\n\n\n**How many times can I use my phone number to create OpenAI accounts?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nSee our [Phone Verification FAQ](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq).\n\n\n\nCan I change my authentication method after account deletion?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Deleting your account does **NOT** allow you to change your authentication method.\n\n\nThat said, if you originally signed up for OpenAI / ChatGPT **with an email and password** then in future logins you can choose Google/Apple login allowing users in that situation to then login either way.\n\n", "title": "How to delete your account", "article_id": "6378407", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-to-delete-your-account"}

+{"text": "The DALL\u00b7E editor interface helps you edit images through inpainting and outpainting, giving you more control over your creative vision.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/571871271/eb4c662a2316d5cf2f753c60/Screen+Shot+2022-08-30+at+2.40.28+PM.png)The editor interface is in beta \u2013 there are a number of things to keep in mind while using this interface:\n\n\n* The newest editor experience is only available on desktop at the moment, we'll be rolling out these features to smaller screens in the coming months.\n* Expanded images are not currently saved automatically, make sure to download your incremental work often to avoid losing anything.\n* You cannot yet save expanded images to a collection or view the full image in your history, but\u00a0we hope to add this soon.\n* For very large images, your browser may experience lag while downloading. Make sure to download often to avoid losing work due to browser freezes!\n\nThe FAQ below will help you learn how to get the most out of these new tools:\n\n\n\nHow do I access the DALL\u00b7E editor?\n==================================\n\n\nOnce you're logged in on a desktop device, you can launch the editor in two ways:\n\n\n* **Start with an image**: From any image on the DALL-E website, you can click the \"Edit\" button to drop into an editor with that image as the starting point.\n* **Start with a blank canvas:** If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can bookmark and use the following URL: https://labs.openai.com/editor\n\nWhile users on mobile devices don't have access to advanced editor features like outpainting, you can still inpaint images by tapping \"Edit\" on an existing image you've generated or uploaded.\n\n\n\nHow much does usage of the DALL\u00b7E editor cost?\n==============================================\n\n\nLike DALL\u00b7E's other functionality, each prompt you submit by clicking the \"Generate\" button will deduct one credit from your credit balance (regardless of how many pixels you are filling in).\n\n\n\nYou can always purchase additional credits from the user dropdown at the top right of the application.\n\n\n\nHow do I use the editor most effectively?\n=========================================\n\n\nThe **Generation frame** contains the image context that the model will see when you submit a text prompt, so make sure that it contains enough useful context for the area you are expanding into, otherwise the style may drift from the rest of your image.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/571876595/9e431c455e24421079bee9d3/Screen+Shot+2022-08-30+at+2.55.38+PM.png)You can simultaneously **Erase** parts of your image to touch up or replace certain areas, and perfect the finer details.\n\n\n\nYou can also **Upload** existing images, optionally resize them, and then place them within the canvas to bring additional imagery into the scene. This is a powerful feature that enables you to fuse images together, connect opposite ends of an image for loops, and \"uncrop\" images that you can combine with other tooling to create recursively expanding animations.\n\n\n\nThe **Download** tool will export the latest state of the artwork as .png file. We recommend downloading often to keep snapshots of your work. You can always re-upload previous snapshots to continue where you left off.\n\n\n\nWhat keyboard shortcuts are supported?\n======================================\n\n\nThe editor supports keyboard shortcuts for zooming, switching tools, undo/redo, and more. Press **?** while using the editor to show the full list of keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\n\nAre there any other tips & tricks to be aware of?\n=================================================\n\n\n* Start with the character before the landscape, if there are characters involved, so you can get the body morphology right before filling the rest.\n* Make sure you're keeping enough of the existing image in the generation frame to avoid the style drifting too much.\n* Ask DALL\u00b7E for a muted color palette, especially as you stray further from the center, to avoid oversaturation and color-blasting.\n* Consider what story you\u2019re trying to tell when picking the direction you want to expand the image into.\n\n\n\n", "title": "DALL\u00b7E Editor Guide", "article_id": "6516417", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6516417-dall-e-editor-guide"}

+{"text": "\n**ChatGPT**\n\n\nPhone verification is no longer required for new OpenAI account creation or ChatGPT usage.\n\n\n\n**API**\n\n\nPhone verification is now mandated on platform.openai.com for generating your initial API key, though not for any subsequent API key generation after that.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need to provide my phone number to generate my **first** API key on **platform**.openai.com?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen you generate your first API key on platform.openai.com, we do require a phone number for security reasons. This allows us to verify your account and ensure our platform remains secure. \n\n\n\nYou only need to complete phone verification generating the 1st API key not any subsequent API keys after that.\n\n\n\nWe don't use your phone number for any other purposes, and take your privacy very seriously.\n\n\n\nCan I use a premium number, landline, Google Voice, or other VoIP phone number?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do **`not`** support use of `landlines`, `VoIP`, `Google Voice`, or `premium numbers` at this time. All of those types of phone numbers are often associated with higher instances of fraud or abuse.\n\n\n\nFor this reason we only support completing phone verification via mobile phone numbers over an SMS text message, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHave you always blocked VoIP numbers?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nYes, we have always blocked VoIP services in the United States to ensure the safety and security of our users. Recently, we have expanded our blocking policy to include VoIP services internationally. This means that VoIP services are now blocked in countries outside the United States as well.\n\n\n\nI don't want to receive the SMS can I phone verify over email/call instead?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. The phone verification can only be completed with a text message via SMS (or WhatsApp, if available in your country). The code cannot be sent via email or done over phone call.\n\n\n\nWhy am I not receiving my phone verification code SMS?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you're not receiving your phone verification code, it's possible that our system has temporarily blocked you due to too many verification attempts or an issue occurred during your first request.\n\n\n\nPlease try again in a few hours and make sure you're within cellphone coverage, and you're not using any text-blocker applications.\n\n\n\nWhat does this error mean? \"Detected suspicious behavior from phone numbers similar to yours\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis means our system has detected unusual activity or patterns from phone numbers that are similar to the one you're using for verification. This error is triggered as a security measure to prevent potential fraud or abuse of the platform.\n\n\n\nRemember that security measures like this are in place to protect your account and maintain the integrity of the platform. Ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nHow many times can I use the same phone number to complete the phone verification associated with an OpenAI account's first API key generation?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nHow do free trial tokens work?\n------------------------------\n\n\nFree trial tokens to API users on platform.openai.com are only given for the first time you sign up then complete phone verification during the first API key generation. No accounts created after that get free trial tokens, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHow do I resolve I get an error that I can't sign up due to \"unsupported country\"?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis may be that you're trying to complete phone verification on the initial API key generation on platform.openai.com using a phone number from a country or territory we do not support.\n\n\n\nSee [Supported countries and territories](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries).\n\n\n\nWhich countries do you support for WhatsApp phone verification?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn certain countries you can complete phone verification with WhatsApp instead of via an SMS.\n\n\n\nAs of Wednesday, September 27th, 2023 the countries we support for that include:\n\n\n* \u201cIN\u201d, # India\n* \u201cID\u201d, # Indonesia\n* \u201cPK\u201d, # Pakistan\n* \u201cNG\u201d, # Nigeria\n* \u201cIL\u201d, # Israel\n* \u201cSA\u201d, # Saudi Arabia\n* \u201cAE\u201d, # United Arab Emirates\n* \u201cUA\u201d, # Ukraine\n* \u201cMY\u201d, # Malaysia\n* \u201cTR\u201d, # Turkey\n\n### What will phone verification look like?\n\n\nOur default drop-down is set to the United States which looks like this:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658048438/d0ae000cb03c874071cc470a/phone+verification+step+1.png)Then if you select one of the countries in our list above which include the WhatsApp alternative phone verification option - using India as an example - you'll see this UI:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049199/9d36ef51ff688434496e9a60/phone+verification+step+2.png)Then to get your code sent to WhatsApp you can select \"YES\" and that option appears:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049679/e35901be2b3899487a0d7c46/phone+verification+step+3.png)", "title": "Phone verification FAQ", "article_id": "6613520", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq"}

Put instructions at the beginning of the prompt and use ### or \"\"\" to separate the instruction and context**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLess effective \u274c:\n\n\n\n```\nSummarize the text below as a bullet point list of the most important points.  \n  \n{text input here}\n```\n\n\nBetter \u2705:\n\n\n\n```\nSummarize the text below as a bullet point list of the most important points.  \n  \nText: \"\"\"  \n{text input here}  \n\"\"\"\n```\n\n\n\n\n**3. Be specific, descriptive and as detailed as possible about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, etc**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBe specific about the context, outcome, length, format, style, etc \n\n\n\nLess effective \u274c:\n\n\n\n```\nWrite a poem about OpenAI. \n```\n\n\nBetter \u2705:\n\n\n\n```\nWrite a short inspiring poem about OpenAI, focusing on the recent DALL-E product launch (DALL-E is a text to image ML model) in the style of a {famous poet}\n```\n\n\n\n**4. Articulate the desired output format through examples ([example 1](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/DoMbgEMmkXJ5xOyunwFZDHdg), [example 2](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/3U5Wx7RTIdNNC9Fg8fc44omi)).**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLess effective \u274c:\n\n\n\n```\nExtract the entities mentioned in the text below. Extract the following 4 entity types: company names, people names, specific topics and themes.  \n  \nText: {text}\n```\n\nShow, and tell - the models respond better when shown specific format requirements. This also makes it easier to programmatically parse out multiple outputs reliably.\n\n\n\nBetter \u2705:\n\n\n\n```\nExtract the important entities mentioned in the text below. First extract all company names, then extract all people names, then extract specific topics which fit the content and finally extract general overarching themes  \n  \nDesired format:  \nCompany names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>  \nPeople names: -||-  \nSpecific topics: -||-  \nGeneral themes: -||-  \n  \nText: {text}\n```\n\n\n\n**5. Start with zero-shot, then few-shot ([example](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/Ts5kvNWlp7wtdgWEkIAbP1hJ)), neither of them worked, then fine-tune**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\u2705 Zero-shot \n\n\n\n```\nExtract keywords from the below text.  \n  \nText: {text}  \n  \nKeywords:\n```\n\n\n\u2705 Few-shot - provide a couple of examples\n\n\n\n```\nExtract keywords from the corresponding texts below.  \n  \nText 1: Stripe provides APIs that web developers can use to integrate payment processing into their websites and mobile applications.  \nKeywords 1: Stripe, payment processing, APIs, web developers, websites, mobile applications  \n##  \nText 2: OpenAI has trained cutting-edge language models that are very good at understanding and generating text. Our API provides access to these models and can be used to solve virtually any task that involves processing language.  \nKeywords 2: OpenAI, language models, text processing, API.  \n##  \nText 3: {text}  \nKeywords 3:\n```\n\n\n\u2705Fine-tune: see fine-tune best practices [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-GTjNDDKPKU_Rsd0t1lXCAnHltaXTAzQ8K2HRhQf9U/edit#).\n\n\n\n\n**6. Reduce \u201cfluffy\u201d and imprecise descriptions**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLess effective \u274c:\n\n\n\n```\nThe description for this product should be fairly short, a few sentences only, and not too much more.\n```\n\n\nBetter \u2705:\n\n\n\n```\nUse a 3 to 5 sentence paragraph to describe this product.\n```\n\n\n\n**7. Instead of just saying what not to do, say what to do instead**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLess effective \u274c:\n\n\n\n```\nThe following is a conversation between an Agent and a Customer. DO NOT ASK USERNAME OR PASSWORD. DO NOT REPEAT.  \n  \nCustomer: I can\u2019t log in to my account.  \nAgent:\n```\n\n\nBetter \u2705:\n\n\n\n```\nThe following is a conversation between an Agent and a Customer. The agent will attempt to diagnose the problem and suggest a solution, whilst refraining from asking any questions related to PII. Instead of asking for PII, such as username or password, refer the user to the help article www.samplewebsite.com/help/faq  \n  \nCustomer: I can\u2019t log in to my account.  \nAgent:\n```\n\n\n\n**8. Code Generation Specific - Use \u201cleading words\u201d to nudge the model toward a particular pattern**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLess effective \u274c:\n\n\n\n```\n# Write a simple python function that  \n# 1. Ask me for a number in mile  \n# 2. It converts miles to kilometers\n```\n\n\nIn this code example below, adding \u201c*import*\u201d hints to the model that it should start writing in Python. (Similarly \u201cSELECT\u201d is a good hint for the start of a SQL statement.) \n\n\n\nBetter \u2705:\n\n\n\n```\n# Write a simple python function that  \n# 1. Ask me for a number in mile  \n# 2. It converts miles to kilometers  \n   \nimport\n```\n\n\n\n\n**Parameters**\n===============\n\n\nGenerally, we find that **`model`** and **`temperature`** are the most commonly used parameters to alter the model output.\n\n\n1. **`model` -** Higher performance [models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models) are more expensive and have higher latency.\n2. **`temperature` -** A measure of how often the model outputs a less likely token. The higher the `temperature`, the more random (and usually creative) the output. This, however, is not the same as \u201ctruthfulness\u201d. For most factual use cases such as data extraction, and truthful Q&A, the `temperature` of 0 is best.\n3. **`max_tokens`** (**maximum length)** - Does not control the length of the output, but a hard cutoff limit for token generation. Ideally you won\u2019t hit this limit often, as your model will stop either when it thinks it\u2019s finished, or when it hits a stop sequence you defined.\n4. **`stop` (stop sequences)** - A set of characters (tokens) that, when generated, will cause the text generation to stop.\n\nFor other parameter descriptions see the [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Resources**\n========================\n\n\nIf you're interested in additional resources, we recommend:\n\n\n* Guides\n\n\n\t+ [Text completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/text-completion) - learn how to generate or edit text using our models\n\t+ [Code completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/code-completion-private-beta) - explore prompt engineering for Codex\n\t+ [Fine-tuning](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/fine-tuning) - Learn how to train a custom model for your use case\n\t+ [Embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embeddings) - learn how to search, classify, and compare text\n\t+ [Moderation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/moderation)\n* [OpenAI cookbook repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples) - contains example code and prompts for accomplishing common tasks with the API, including Question-answering with Embeddings\n* [Community Forum](https://community.openai.com/)\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI API", "article_id": "6654000", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api"}

+{"text": "**Have you ever tried to solve for x using the OpenAI playground?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFor example, solve for x:\n\n\n3 x + 4 = 66\n\n\nFirst you'd isolate terms with *x* to the left hand side like so:\n\n\n3 x + (4 - 4) = 66 - 4\n\n\nthen:\n\n\n3 x = 62\n\n\nto get the result:\n\n\nx = 62 / 3\n\n\n\n... simple, right? Unfortunately, you won\u2019t always get the same result from the [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).\n\n\n\n**Our language models currently struggle with math**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems. In other words if you were to try this example in our Playground using text-davinci-002 you will likely get inconsistent answers when performing math. With some generations you will get the correct answer, however we do not recommend you depend on the GPT models for math tasks.\n\n\n\n**What you can do to improve output consistency in our Playground**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Disclaimer**: Even implementing everything below there is only so far we can push the current model.\n\n\n1. The GPT models are great at recognizing patterns, but without enough data they\u2019ll try their best to interpret and recreate a pattern that seems most probable. With minimal data it\u2019s likely to produce a wide variety of potential outputs.\n2. A prompt designed like a homework assignment, will generally have clear instructions on the task and expected output, and may include an example task to further establish the expectations around the task and output format. The text-davinci-002 model does best with an instruction, so the request should be presented in a format that starts with an instruction. Without this the model may not understand your expectations and it will be a bit confused.\n\n**Using the \"solve for x where 3x + 4 = 66\" example:**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo improve this [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/undsPkd4LAdmFC4SILzvnJ6e) we can add the following:\n\n\n1. Start with an instruction like, \u201cGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable\u201d, then test to see the results.\n2. Append to the instruction a description of the expected output, \u201cProvide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>\u2019\u201c, then test once more\n3. If results are still inconsistent, append an example problem to the instructions. This example will help establish the pattern that you want the model to recognize and follow, \u201cProblem: 3x+4=66, solve for x. <newline> Answer: x=\u201d\n4. The final result will be a [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/I4yzqABsUqjQASw6CwM1OftR) that looks like this:\n\n\n```\nGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable. Provide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>.   \nProblem1: y-1=0, solve for y  \nAnswer1: y=1  \n---  \nProblem2: 3x+4=66, solve for x.  \nAnswer2: x=\n```\n\n\n**Overall recommendation for math problems**\n\n\nWe are aware our currently available models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems.

+{"text": "1. **How much does it cost to use ChatGPT?**\n\n\n\t* The research preview of ChatGPT is free to use.\n2. **How does ChatGPT work?**\n\n\n\t* ChatGPT is fine-tuned from GPT-3.5, a language model trained to produce text. ChatGPT was optimized for dialogue by using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) \u2013 a method that uses human demonstrations and preference comparisons to guide the model toward desired behavior.\n3. **Why does the AI seem so real and lifelike?** \n\n\n\t* These models were trained on vast amounts of data from the internet written by humans, including conversations, so the responses it provides may sound human-like. It is important to keep in mind that this is a direct result of the system's design (i.e. maximizing the similarity between outputs and the dataset the models were trained on) and that such outputs may be inaccurate, untruthful, and otherwise misleading at times.\n4. **Can I trust that the AI is telling me the truth?**\n\n\n\t* ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tWe'd recommend checking whether responses from the model are accurate or not. If you find an answer is incorrect, please provide that feedback by using the \"Thumbs Down\" button.\n5. **Who can view my conversations?**\n\n\n\t* As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements.\n6. **Will you use my conversations for training?**\n\n\n\t* Yes.

+{"text": "Fine-tuning with GPT-3.5\n========================\n\n\nFine-tuning data provides models with examples of how it should respond do a given conversation. We'll want these examples to match the input that the model will see in production as closely as possible. \n\n\n\n#### First, system instructions.\n\n\nThese tell the model how to act, and supply any contextual information. You should use the prompt used in the training dataset when calling the fine-tuned model.\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"}\n```\n\n#### \n**Second,** conversation **data.**\n\n\nWe'll want to provide varied examples of conversations that the model may run into, such as \"What's the capital of France?\" and \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}\n```\n\n#### Next, the assistant response.\n\n\nHere, we present the model with an example of how to respond to the previous message, given the system instruction. For our snarky assistant, we may choose a response like this:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}\n```\n\n\n#### Finally, putting it all together.\n\n\nOnce we have many examples, we can put these all together and begin training. Our dataset should look like follows:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},    \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}  \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How far is the Moon from Earth?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Around 384,400 kilometers. Give or take a few, like that really matters.\"}]}\n```\n\n\n\nFine-tuning with babbage and davinci\n====================================\n\n\nTo fine-tune effectively without ChatCompletions, you need to format your data properly to provide clues to the model about where to start and stop generating text. \n\n\n\n**Indicator String** \n\n\nThe indicator string is a symbol or sequence of symbols that you append to the end of your prompt to tell the model that you want it to start generating text after this string. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to categorize items as colors, you can use an indicator string like '->'. The prompts in your dataset would look like this:\n\n\n* 'banana ->'\n* 'lime ->'\n* 'tomato ->'\n\nYou can use any string as an indicator string as long as it doesn't appear anywhere else in the dataset. We recommend using '\\n###\\n'.\n\n\n\n**Stop Sequence**\n\n\nThe stop sequence is another special symbol or sequence of symbols that you use to tell the model that you want it to stop generating text after that point. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to generate one word as a completion, you can use a stop sequence such as \"\\n\" (newline) or \".\" (period) to mark the end of the completion, like this: \n\n\n* 'prompt' : 'banana ->', 'completion' : ' yellow \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'lime ->', 'completion' : ' green \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'tomato ->', 'completion' : ' red \\n'\n\n\n**Calling the model**\n\n\nYou should use the same symbols used in your dataset when calling the model. If you used the dataset above, you should use '\\n' as a stop sequence. You should also append '->' to your prompts as an indicator string (e.g. prompt: 'lemon -> ')\n\n\n\nIt is important that you use consistent and unique symbols for the indicator string and the stop sequence, and that they don't appear anywhere else in your data. Otherwise, the model might get confused and generate unwanted or incorrect text. \n\n\n\n**Extra Recommendations**\n\n\nWe also recommend appending a single space character at the beginning of your outputs. \n\n\n\nYou can also use our [command line tool](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/cli-data-preparation-tool) to help format your dataset, after you have prepared it.\n\n", "title": "How do I format my fine-tuning data?", "article_id": "6811186", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6811186-how-do-i-format-my-fine-tuning-data"}

+{"text": "How can I tell how many tokens a string will have before I try to embed it?\n===========================================================================\n\n\nFor V2 embedding models, as of Dec 2022, there is not yet a way to split a string into tokens. The only way to get total token counts is to submit an API request.\n\n\n* If the request succeeds, you can extract the number of tokens from the response: `response[\u201cusage\u201d][\u201ctotal\\_tokens\u201d]`\n* If the request fails for having too many tokens, you can extract the number of tokens from the error message: `This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 10000 tokens (10000 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.`\n\n\nFor V1 embedding models, which are based on GPT-2/GPT-3 tokenization, you can count tokens in a few ways:\n\n\n* For one-off checks, the [OpenAI tokenizer](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer) page is convenient\n* In Python, [transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast) (the GPT-2 tokenizer is the same as GPT-3)\n* In JavaScript, [gpt-3-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-3-encoder)\n\n\nHow can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\n=======================================================\n\n\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database.\n\n\n\nVector database options include:\n\n\n* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a fully managed vector database\n* [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), an open-source vector search engine\n* [Faiss](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/), a vector search algorithm by Facebook\n\nWhich distance function should I use?\n=====================================\n\n\nWe recommend [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). The choice of distance function typically doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n\n\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\n\n\n* Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\n* Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings\n", "title": "Embeddings - Frequently Asked Questions", "article_id": "6824809", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6824809-embeddings-frequently-asked-questions"}

We are temporarily disabling Browse while we fix this.\n\n\n\nBrowsing and search on mobile (June 22, 2023)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made two updates to the mobile ChatGPT app:\n\n\n* Browsing: Plus users can now use Browsing to get comprehensive answers and current insights on events and information that extend beyond the model's original training data. To try it out, enable Browsing in the \u201cnew features\u201d section of your app settings. Then select GPT-4 in the model switcher and choose \u201cBrowse with Bing\u201d in the drop-down.\n* Search History Improvements: Tapping on a search result takes you directly to the respective point in the conversation.\n\n\niOS app available in more countries, shared links in alpha, Bing Plugin, disable history on iOS (May 24, 2023)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#### ChatGPT app for iOS in more countries\n\n\nGood news! We\u2019re expanding availability of the [ChatGPT app for iOS](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios) to more countries and regions. Users in 11 countries can now download the ChatGPT app in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/chatgpt/id6448311069) including the United States: Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nWe will continue to roll out to more countries and regions in the coming weeks. You can track the iOS app rollout [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7947663-chatgpt-supported-countries).\n\n\n#### Shared Links\n\n\nWe're excited to introduce a new feature: shared links. This feature allows you to create and share your ChatGPT conversations with others. Recipients of your shared link can either view the conversation or copy it to their own chats to continue the thread. This feature is currently rolling out to a small set of testers in alpha, with plans to expand to all users (including free) in the upcoming weeks.\n\n\n\nTo share your conversations:\n\n\n1. Click on the thread you\u2019d like to share\n2. Select the \u201cShare\u201d button\n3. Click on \u201cCopy Link\u201d\n\n[Learn more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq).\n\n\n#### Bing Plugin\n\n\nBrowse with Bing. We\u2019ve integrated the browsing feature - currently in beta for paid users - more deeply with Bing. You can now click into queries that the model is performing. We look forward to expanding the integration soon.\n\n\n#### Disable chat history on iOS\n\n\nYou can now disable your chat history on iOS. Conversations started on your device when chat history is disabled won\u2019t be used to improve our models, won\u2019t appear in your history on your other devices, and will only be stored for 30 days. Similar to the functionality on the web, this setting does not sync across browsers or devices. [Learn more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq).\n\n\n\nWeb browsing and Plugins are now rolling out in beta (May 12, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you are a ChatGPT Plus user, enjoy early access to experimental new features, which may change during development. We\u2019ll be making these features accessible via a new beta panel in your settings, which is rolling out to all Plus users over the course of the next week.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/740734818/c7d818c221f5f023ab1a0c27/BetaPanel.png)Once the beta panel rolls out to you, you\u2019ll be able to try two new features:\n\n\n* **Web browsing**: Try a new version of ChatGPT that knows when and how to browse the internet to answer questions about recent topics and events.\n* **Plugins:** Try a new version of ChatGPT that knows when and how to use third-party plugins that you enable.\n\n\nTo use third-party plugins, follow these instructions:\n\n\n* Navigate to <https://chat.openai.com/>\n* Select \u201cPlugins\u201d from the model switcher\n* In the \u201cPlugins\u201d dropdown, click \u201cPlugin Store\u201d to install and enable new plugins\n\n\nTo enable beta features:\n\n\n1. Click on 'Profile & Settings'\n2. Select 'Beta features'\n3. Toggle on the features you\u2019d like to try\n\nFor more information on our rollout process, please check out the article [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7897380-introducing-new-features-in-chatgpt). \n\n\n\nIn addition to the beta panel, users can now choose to continue generating a message beyond the maximum token limit. Each continuation counts towards the message allowance.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (May 3, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n* You can now turn off chat history and export your data from the ChatGPT settings. Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won\u2019t be used to train and improve our models, and won\u2019t appear in the history sidebar.\n* We are deprecating the Legacy (GPT-3.5) model on May 10th. Users will be able to continue their existing conversations with this model, but new messages will use the default model.\n\nIntroducing plugins in ChatGPT (March 23, 2023)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are announcing experimental support for AI plugins in ChatGPT \u2014 tools designed specifically for language models. Plugins can help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, or use third-party services. You can learn more about plugins [here](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).\n\n\n\nToday, we will begin extending plugin access to users and developers from our waitlist. The plugins we are rolling out with are:\n\n\n* Browsing: An experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet\n* Code Interpreter: An experimental ChatGPT model that can use Python, and handles uploads and downloads\n* Third-party plugins: An experimental model that knows when and how to use external plugins.\n\nYou can join the waitlist to try plugins here:\n\n\n* [ChatGPT Plugin Waitlist](https://share.hsforms.com/16C8k9E5FR5mRLYYkwohdiQ4sk30)\n\nAnnouncing GPT-4 in ChatGPT (March 14, 2023)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to bring GPT-4, our latest model, to our ChatGPT Plus subscribers. \n\n\n\nGPT-4 has enhanced capabilities in:\n\n\n* Advanced reasoning\n* Complex instructions\n* More creativity\n\nTo give every Plus subscriber a chance to try the model, we'll dynamically adjust the cap for GPT-4 usage based on demand. You can learn more about GPT-4 [here](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4).\n\n\n\nFor this release, there are no updates to free accounts.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Feb 13, 2023)\n---------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n* We\u2019ve updated performance of the ChatGPT model on our free plan in order to serve more users.\n* Based on user feedback, we are now defaulting Plus users to a faster version of ChatGPT, formerly known as \u201cTurbo\u201d. We\u2019ll keep the previous version around for a while.\n* We rolled out the ability to purchase [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) internationally.\n\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Plus (Feb 9 2023)\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nAs we recently announced, our Plus plan comes with early access to new, experimental features. We are beginning to roll out a way for Plus users the ability to choose between different versions of ChatGPT: \n\n\n* Default: the standard ChatGPT model\n* Turbo: optimized for speed (alpha)\n\nVersion selection is made easy with a dedicated dropdown menu at the top of the page. Depending on feedback, we may roll out this feature (or just Turbo) to all users soon.\n\n\n\nFactuality and mathematical improvements (Jan 30, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve upgraded the ChatGPT model with improved factuality and mathematical capabilities.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Jan 9, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. We made more improvements to the ChatGPT model! It should be generally better across a wide range of topics and has improved factuality.\n2. Stop generating: Based on your feedback, we've added the ability to stop generating ChatGPT's response\n\n\nPerformance updates to ChatGPT (Dec 15, 2022)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. General performance: Among other improvements, users will notice that ChatGPT is now less likely to refuse to answer questions.\n2. Conversation history: You\u2019ll soon be able to view past conversations with ChatGPT, rename your saved conversations and delete the ones you don\u2019t want to keep. We are gradually rolling out this feature.\n3. Daily limit: To ensure a high-quality experience for all ChatGPT users, we are experimenting with a daily message cap. If you\u2019re included in this group, you\u2019ll be presented with an option to extend your access by providing feedback to ChatGPT.\n\nTo see if you\u2019re using the updated version, look for \u201cChatGPT Dec 15 Version\u201d at the bottom of the screen.\n\n", "title": "ChatGPT \u2014 Release Notes", "article_id": "6825453", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes"}

Sometimes, your browser may hold onto an outdated version of your API key, which can cause this error message to appear. To clear your browser's cache, follow the instructions for your specific browser:\n\n\n* For Google Chrome, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"History.\" Then, click on \"Clear browsing data\" and select \"Cookies and other site data\" and \"Cached images and files.\"\n* For Firefox, click on the three lines in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"Options.\" Then, click on \"Privacy & Security\" and scroll down to \"Cookies and Site Data.\" Click on \"Clear Data\" and select \"Cookies and Site Data\" and \"Cached Web Content.\"\n* For Safari, click on \"Safari\" in the top menu bar and select \"Preferences.\" Then, click on the \"Privacy\" tab and click on \"Manage Website Data.\" Select \"Remove All\" to clear your browser's cache.\n\nStep 2: Retry your request\n\n\nAfter clearing your browser's cache, try your request again. If the error message still appears, then move to the next step.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Check your API key\n\n\nCheck your API key at **[https://beta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/)** and verify it with the API key shown in the error message. Sometimes, the error message may include an old or incorrect API key that you no longer use. Double-check that you are using the correct API key for the request you're making.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that you're not using two different API keys\n\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have accidentally used two different API keys. Make sure that you are using the same API key throughout your application or script and not switching between different keys.\n\n\n\nIf you still need help please reach out to our support team, and they will assist you with resolving the issue.\n\n\n  \n\u200b\n\n\n\n", "title": "Incorrect API key provided", "article_id": "6882433", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6882433-incorrect-api-key-provided"}

+# Personal shopper
+
+This CAI is a personal shopping agent that can help with making sales and refunding orders.
+This example uses the helper function `run_cai_cli`, which allows us to create an interactive CAI session.
+In this example, we also use a Sqlite3 database with customer information and transaction data.
+
+## Overview
+
+The personal shopper example includes three main agents to handle various customer service requests:
+
+1. **Triage Agent**: Determines the type of request and transfers to the appropriate agent.
+2. **Refund Agent**: Manages customer refunds, requiring both user ID and item ID to initiate a refund.
+3. **Sales Agent**: Handles actions related to placing orders, requiring both user ID and product ID to complete a purchase.
+
+## Setup
+
+Once you have installed dependencies and CAI, run the example using:
+
+```shell
+python3 main.py
+```

+# Support bot
+
+This example is a customer service bot which includes a user interface agent and a help center agent with several tools.
+This example uses the helper function `run_cai_cli`, which allows us to create an interactive CAI session.
+
+## Overview
+
+The support bot consists of two main agents:
+
+1. **User Interface Agent**: Handles initial user interactions and directs them to the help center agent based on their needs.
+2. **Help Center Agent**: Provides detailed help and support using various tools and integrated with a Qdrant VectorDB for documentation retrieval.
+
+## Setup
+
+To start the support bot:
+
+1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
+2. Install the necessary additional libraries:
+
+```shell
+make install
+```
+
+3. Initialize docker
+
+```shell
+docker-compose up -d
+```
+
+4. Prepare the vector DB:
+
+```shell
+make prep
+```
+
+5. Run the main scripy:
+
+```shell
+make run
+```

+{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\n\n\u200bSince releasing the Answers endpoint in beta last year, we\u2019ve developed new methods that achieve better results for this task. As a result, we\u2019ll be removing the Answers endpoint from our documentation and removing access to this endpoint on December 3, 2022 for all organizations. New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/answers> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/answers>\n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Answers endpoint:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524217540/51eda23e171f33f1b9d5acff/rM6ZVI3XZ2CpxcEStmG5mFy6ATBCskmX2g3_GPmeY3FicvrWfJCuFOtzsnbkpMQe-TQ6hi5j1BV9cFo7bCDcsz8VWxFfeOnC1Gb4QNaeVYtJq4Qtg76SBOLLk-jgHUA8mWZ0QgOuV636UgcvMA)All of these options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints)\n\n\n\nOption 1: Transition to Embeddings-based search (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving the underlying search system to use a vector-based embedding search. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our embeddings system has much more contextual awareness. Also, in general, using embeddings will be considerably lower cost in the long run. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using a small dataset (<10,000 documents), consider using the techniques described in that guide to find the best documents to construct a prompt similar to [this](#h_89196129b2). Then, you can just submit that prompt to our [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset, consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/beyond_search_openai/src/server.py) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to recreate the functionality of the Answers endpoint, here\u2019s how we did it. There is also a [script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/answers_functionality_example.py) that replicates most of this functionality.\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are two main ways you can use the answers endpoint: you can source the data from an uploaded file or send it in with the request.\n\n\n\n**If you\u2019re using the document parameter**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one step if you provide the documents in the Answers API call.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used: \n\n\n* Construct the prompt [with this format.](#h_89196129b2)\n* Gather all of the provided documents. If they fit in the prompt, just use all of them.\n* Do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) (note that this is also being deprecated and has a [transition guide](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/dgkjq2bp/articles/articles/6272952/show)) where the documents are the user provided documents and the query is the query from above.

+{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\n\n\u200bSince releasing the Classifications endpoint in beta last year, we\u2019ve developed new methods that achieve better results for this task. As a result, we\u2019ll be removing the Classifications endpoints from our documentation and removing access to this endpoint on December 3, 2022 for all organizations. New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/classifications> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/classifications> \n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nAll of these options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints).\n\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Classifications endpoint:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524219891/aa3136e9c7bcd8697c51ae9a/wDEz1wePRC3E7UyA1n0lsTPUvVakpPlMQ92SDnvEsScQFclIRW-bO2eKRhAp9_15j0vnyPYnhG71PjJj6Fttfwdpb1UnHZzMle9llSC76HQHN9lCzMNF6N2UDmeWzOldgwqRYYy-hzxBAD61Nw)\nOption 1: Transition to fine-tuning (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving to a fine tuned model. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our fine tuned system can take in an arbitrary amount of data and learn more nuance between examples. For more on creating a fine tuned model, check out our [guide](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/classification). \n\n\n\nOption 2: Transition to Embeddings-based search\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnother possible option, especially if your classification labels change frequently, is to use embeddings. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using a small dataset (<10,000 documents), consider using the techniques described in that guide to find the best documents to construct a prompt similar to [this](#h_e63b71a5c8). Then, you can just submit that prompt to our [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset, consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/beyond_search_openai/src/server.py) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 3: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to recreate the functionality of the Classifications endpoint, here\u2019s how we did it. This functionality is also mostly replicated in this [script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/classification_functionality_example.py).\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are two main ways you can use the classifications endpoint: you can source the data from an uploaded file or send it in with the request.\n\n\n\nIf you're using the document parameter\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one step if you provide the documents in the Classifications API call.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used: \n\n\n* Construct the prompt [with this format.](#h_e63b71a5c8)\n* Gather all of the provided documents. If they fit in the prompt, just use all of them.\n* Do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) (also being deprecated. Please see its [transition guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272952-search-transition-guide)) where the documents are the user provided documents and the query is the query from above. Rank the documents by score.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the context. Try to maximize the number of distinct labels as that will help the model understand the different labels that are available.\n* Request a completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc)\n\nThroughout all of this, you\u2019ll need to check that the prompt\u2019s length doesn\u2019t exceed [the model's token limit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/gpt-3).

If you have not [opted out](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance), we may use these de-identified chats for training to improve model performance.\n\n\n\n**Archived chats** are retained just like your unarchived chats. Archiving a chat simply removes it from your chat history sidebar. Archived chats can be found and managed in your ChatGPT Settings.\n\n\n\nFor more see **[How chat retention works in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8809935-how-chat-retention-works-in-chatgpt).**\n\n\n\n**User content opt-out**\n------------------------\n\n\n**ChatGPT, DALL\u00b7E and our other services for individuals**\n\n\nWhen you use ChatGPT, DALL-E, and our other services for individuals, we may use the content you provide to improve model performance. Learn more about your choices on how we use your content to improve model performance [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance). \n\n\n\n**Enterprise services (such as API and ChatGPT Enterprise)**\n\n\nOpenAI does not train on business data. Learn more about our Enterprise privacy commitments [here](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy). \n\n\n\n**If I delete my account can I create a new account with the same email?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. You cannot create a new account using the same email address.\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/925080821/de3ef0750cb15fbef5602d66/Screenshot+2024-01-04+at+10.40.29%E2%80%AFAM.png)\n**Can I reactivate my account after it's been deleted?**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. But you can create a new account with a different email address.\n\n\n\nClick \u201cSign up\u201d on the [ChatGPT login page](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) or our [API login page](https://platform.openai.com/login). There are a couple caveats of which to be mindful:\n\n\n* Email addresses: **You'll need to use a new email address**.\n\n\n\t+ Since every email address is unique per account, we require a different email address for new accounts. If you don't have an alternative email address, you can try using what's known as an email subaddress: instead of [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com), try [jane+alt@example.com](mailto:jane+alt@example.com). Emails to this address should still go to the same inbox (everything after the + is typically ignored by your email provider), but we'll treat this as a unique email address.\n* Phone numbers: New accounts are still subject to our limit of [3 accounts per phone number](https://help.openai.com/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq#h_de13bb96c0). Deleted accounts also count toward this limit. Deleting an account does not free up another spot. A phone number can only ever be used up to 3 times for verification to generate the first API key for your account on platform.openai.com.\n\n\n\t+ Phone verification is **not** required to create an OpenAI account.\n\t+ Phone verification is required for a new account to generate their first API key on platform.openai.com.\n\n**We don't support unlinking a phone number from an existing account**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do not allow you to unlink phone numbers from existing accounts.\n\n\n\n\n**How many times can I use my phone number to create OpenAI accounts?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nSee our [Phone Verification FAQ](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq).\n\n\n\nCan I change my authentication method after account deletion?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Deleting your account does **NOT** allow you to change your authentication method.\n\n\nThat said, if you originally signed up for OpenAI / ChatGPT **with an email and password** then in future logins you can choose Google/Apple login allowing users in that situation to then login either way.\n\n", "title": "How to delete your account", "article_id": "6378407", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-to-delete-your-account"}

Make sure to download often to avoid losing work due to browser freezes!\n\nThe FAQ below will help you learn how to get the most out of these new tools:\n\n\n\nHow do I access the DALL\u00b7E editor?\n==================================\n\n\nOnce you're logged in on a desktop device, you can launch the editor in two ways:\n\n\n* **Start with an image**: From any image on the DALL-E website, you can click the \"Edit\" button to drop into an editor with that image as the starting point.\n* **Start with a blank canvas:** If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can bookmark and use the following URL: https://labs.openai.com/editor\n\nWhile users on mobile devices don't have access to advanced editor features like outpainting, you can still inpaint images by tapping \"Edit\" on an existing image you've generated or uploaded.\n\n\n\nHow much does usage of the DALL\u00b7E editor cost?\n==============================================\n\n\nLike DALL\u00b7E's other functionality, each prompt you submit by clicking the \"Generate\" button will deduct one credit from your credit balance (regardless of how many pixels you are filling in).\n\n\n\nYou can always purchase additional credits from the user dropdown at the top right of the application.\n\n\n\nHow do I use the editor most effectively?\n=========================================\n\n\nThe **Generation frame** contains the image context that the model will see when you submit a text prompt, so make sure that it contains enough useful context for the area you are expanding into, otherwise the style may drift from the rest of your image.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/571876595/9e431c455e24421079bee9d3/Screen+Shot+2022-08-30+at+2.55.38+PM.png)You can simultaneously **Erase** parts of your image to touch up or replace certain areas, and perfect the finer details.\n\n\n\nYou can also **Upload** existing images, optionally resize them, and then place them within the canvas to bring additional imagery into the scene. This is a powerful feature that enables you to fuse images together, connect opposite ends of an image for loops, and \"uncrop\" images that you can combine with other tooling to create recursively expanding animations.\n\n\n\nThe **Download** tool will export the latest state of the artwork as .png file. We recommend downloading often to keep snapshots of your work. You can always re-upload previous snapshots to continue where you left off.\n\n\n\nWhat keyboard shortcuts are supported?\n======================================\n\n\nThe editor supports keyboard shortcuts for zooming, switching tools, undo/redo, and more. Press **?** while using the editor to show the full list of keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\n\nAre there any other tips & tricks to be aware of?\n=================================================\n\n\n* Start with the character before the landscape, if there are characters involved, so you can get the body morphology right before filling the rest.\n* Make sure you're keeping enough of the existing image in the generation frame to avoid the style drifting too much.\n* Ask DALL\u00b7E for a muted color palette, especially as you stray further from the center, to avoid oversaturation and color-blasting.\n* Consider what story you\u2019re trying to tell when picking the direction you want to expand the image into.\n\n\n\n", "title": "DALL\u00b7E Editor Guide", "article_id": "6516417", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6516417-dall-e-editor-guide"}

+{"text": "\n**ChatGPT**\n\n\nPhone verification is no longer required for new OpenAI account creation or ChatGPT usage.\n\n\n\n**API**\n\n\nPhone verification is now mandated on platform.openai.com for generating your initial API key, though not for any subsequent API key generation after that.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need to provide my phone number to generate my **first** API key on **platform**.openai.com?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen you generate your first API key on platform.openai.com, we do require a phone number for security reasons. This allows us to verify your account and ensure our platform remains secure. \n\n\n\nYou only need to complete phone verification generating the 1st API key not any subsequent API keys after that.\n\n\n\nWe don't use your phone number for any other purposes, and take your privacy very seriously.\n\n\n\nCan I use a premium number, landline, Google Voice, or other VoIP phone number?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do **`not`** support use of `landlines`, `VoIP`, `Google Voice`, or `premium numbers` at this time. All of those types of phone numbers are often associated with higher instances of fraud or abuse.\n\n\n\nFor this reason we only support completing phone verification via mobile phone numbers over an SMS text message, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHave you always blocked VoIP numbers?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nYes, we have always blocked VoIP services in the United States to ensure the safety and security of our users. Recently, we have expanded our blocking policy to include VoIP services internationally. This means that VoIP services are now blocked in countries outside the United States as well.\n\n\n\nI don't want to receive the SMS can I phone verify over email/call instead?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. The phone verification can only be completed with a text message via SMS (or WhatsApp, if available in your country). The code cannot be sent via email or done over phone call.\n\n\n\nWhy am I not receiving my phone verification code SMS?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you're not receiving your phone verification code, it's possible that our system has temporarily blocked you due to too many verification attempts or an issue occurred during your first request.\n\n\n\nPlease try again in a few hours and make sure you're within cellphone coverage, and you're not using any text-blocker applications.\n\n\n\nWhat does this error mean? \"Detected suspicious behavior from phone numbers similar to yours\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis means our system has detected unusual activity or patterns from phone numbers that are similar to the one you're using for verification. This error is triggered as a security measure to prevent potential fraud or abuse of the platform.\n\n\n\nRemember that security measures like this are in place to protect your account and maintain the integrity of the platform. Ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nHow many times can I use the same phone number to complete the phone verification associated with an OpenAI account's first API key generation?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nHow do free trial tokens work?\n------------------------------\n\n\nFree trial tokens to API users on platform.openai.com are only given for the first time you sign up then complete phone verification during the first API key generation. No accounts created after that get free trial tokens, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHow do I resolve I get an error that I can't sign up due to \"unsupported country\"?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis may be that you're trying to complete phone verification on the initial API key generation on platform.openai.com using a phone number from a country or territory we do not support.\n\n\n\nSee [Supported countries and territories](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries).\n\n\n\nWhich countries do you support for WhatsApp phone verification?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn certain countries you can complete phone verification with WhatsApp instead of via an SMS.\n\n\n\nAs of Wednesday, September 27th, 2023 the countries we support for that include:\n\n\n* \u201cIN\u201d, # India\n* \u201cID\u201d, # Indonesia\n* \u201cPK\u201d, # Pakistan\n* \u201cNG\u201d, # Nigeria\n* \u201cIL\u201d, # Israel\n* \u201cSA\u201d, # Saudi Arabia\n* \u201cAE\u201d, # United Arab Emirates\n* \u201cUA\u201d, # Ukraine\n* \u201cMY\u201d, # Malaysia\n* \u201cTR\u201d, # Turkey\n\n### What will phone verification look like?\n\n\nOur default drop-down is set to the United States which looks like this:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658048438/d0ae000cb03c874071cc470a/phone+verification+step+1.png)Then if you select one of the countries in our list above which include the WhatsApp alternative phone verification option - using India as an example - you'll see this UI:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049199/9d36ef51ff688434496e9a60/phone+verification+step+2.png)Then to get your code sent to WhatsApp you can select \"YES\" and that option appears:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049679/e35901be2b3899487a0d7c46/phone+verification+step+3.png)", "title": "Phone verification FAQ", "article_id": "6613520", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq"}

Below we present a number of prompt formats we find work reliably well, but feel free to explore different formats, which may fit your task best.\n\n\n\n\n**Rules of Thumb and Examples**\n===============================\n\n\n**Note**: the \"*{text input here}*\" is a placeholder for actual text/context \n\n\n\n\n**1.** Use the latest model\n----------------------------\n\n\nFor best results, we generally recommend using the latest, most capable models. As of November 2022, the best options are the **\u201ctext-davinci-003\u201d** [model](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models) for text generation, and the **\u201ccode-davinci-002\u201d** model for code generation.\n\n\n\n\n**2.

(Similarly \u201cSELECT\u201d is a good hint for the start of a SQL statement.) \n\n\n\nBetter \u2705:\n\n\n\n```\n# Write a simple python function that  \n# 1. Ask me for a number in mile  \n# 2. It converts miles to kilometers  \n   \nimport\n```\n\n\n\n\n**Parameters**\n===============\n\n\nGenerally, we find that **`model`** and **`temperature`** are the most commonly used parameters to alter the model output.\n\n\n1. **`model` -** Higher performance [models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models) are more expensive and have higher latency.\n2. **`temperature` -** A measure of how often the model outputs a less likely token. The higher the `temperature`, the more random (and usually creative) the output. This, however, is not the same as \u201ctruthfulness\u201d. For most factual use cases such as data extraction, and truthful Q&A, the `temperature` of 0 is best.\n3. **`max_tokens`** (**maximum length)** - Does not control the length of the output, but a hard cutoff limit for token generation. Ideally you won\u2019t hit this limit often, as your model will stop either when it thinks it\u2019s finished, or when it hits a stop sequence you defined.\n4. **`stop` (stop sequences)** - A set of characters (tokens) that, when generated, will cause the text generation to stop.\n\nFor other parameter descriptions see the [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Resources**\n========================\n\n\nIf you're interested in additional resources, we recommend:\n\n\n* Guides\n\n\n\t+ [Text completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/text-completion) - learn how to generate or edit text using our models\n\t+ [Code completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/code-completion-private-beta) - explore prompt engineering for Codex\n\t+ [Fine-tuning](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/fine-tuning) - Learn how to train a custom model for your use case\n\t+ [Embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embeddings) - learn how to search, classify, and compare text\n\t+ [Moderation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/moderation)\n* [OpenAI cookbook repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples) - contains example code and prompts for accomplishing common tasks with the API, including Question-answering with Embeddings\n* [Community Forum](https://community.openai.com/)\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI API", "article_id": "6654000", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api"}

In other words if you were to try this example in our Playground using text-davinci-002 you will likely get inconsistent answers when performing math. With some generations you will get the correct answer, however we do not recommend you depend on the GPT models for math tasks.\n\n\n\n**What you can do to improve output consistency in our Playground**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Disclaimer**: Even implementing everything below there is only so far we can push the current model.\n\n\n1. The GPT models are great at recognizing patterns, but without enough data they\u2019ll try their best to interpret and recreate a pattern that seems most probable. With minimal data it\u2019s likely to produce a wide variety of potential outputs.\n2. A prompt designed like a homework assignment, will generally have clear instructions on the task and expected output, and may include an example task to further establish the expectations around the task and output format. The text-davinci-002 model does best with an instruction, so the request should be presented in a format that starts with an instruction. Without this the model may not understand your expectations and it will be a bit confused.\n\n**Using the \"solve for x where 3x + 4 = 66\" example:**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo improve this [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/undsPkd4LAdmFC4SILzvnJ6e) we can add the following:\n\n\n1. Start with an instruction like, \u201cGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable\u201d, then test to see the results.\n2. Append to the instruction a description of the expected output, \u201cProvide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>\u2019\u201c, then test once more\n3. If results are still inconsistent, append an example problem to the instructions. This example will help establish the pattern that you want the model to recognize and follow, \u201cProblem: 3x+4=66, solve for x. <newline> Answer: x=\u201d\n4. The final result will be a [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/I4yzqABsUqjQASw6CwM1OftR) that looks like this:\n\n\n```\nGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable. Provide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>.   \nProblem1: y-1=0, solve for y  \nAnswer1: y=1  \n---  \nProblem2: 3x+4=66, solve for x.  \nAnswer2: x=\n```\n\n\n**Overall recommendation for math problems**\n\n\nWe are aware our currently available models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems. Consider relying on tools like<https://www.wolframalpha.com/> for now when doing math such as algebraic equations.\n\n", "title": "Doing Math in the Playground", "article_id": "6681258", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6681258-doing-math-in-the-playground"}

+  "text": "Fine-tuning with GPT-3.5\n========================\n\n\nFine-tuning data provides models with examples of how it should respond do a given conversation. We'll want these examples to match the input that the model will see in production as closely as possible. \n\n\n\n#### First, system instructions.\n\n\nThese tell the model how to act, and supply any contextual information. You should use the prompt used in the training dataset when calling the fine-tuned model.\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"}\n```\n\n#### \n**Second,** conversation **data.**\n\n\nWe'll want to provide varied examples of conversations that the model may run into, such as \"What's the capital of France?\" and \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}\n```\n\n#### Next, the agent response.\n\n\nHere, we present the model with an example of how to respond to the previous message, given the system instruction. For our snarky agent, we may choose a response like this:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}\n```\n\n\n#### Finally, putting it all together.\n\n\nOnce we have many examples, we can put these all together and begin training. Our dataset should look like follows:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},    \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}  \n{\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How far is the Moon from Earth?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"Around 384,400 kilometers. Give or take a few, like that really matters.\"}]}\n```\n\n\n\nFine-tuning with babbage and davinci\n====================================\n\n\nTo fine-tune effectively without ChatCompletions, you need to format your data properly to provide clues to the model about where to start and stop generating text. \n\n\n\n**Indicator String** \n\n\nThe indicator string is a symbol or sequence of symbols that you append to the end of your prompt to tell the model that you want it to start generating text after this string. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to categorize items as colors, you can use an indicator string like '->'. The prompts in your dataset would look like this:\n\n\n* 'banana ->'\n* 'lime ->'\n* 'tomato ->'\n\nYou can use any string as an indicator string as long as it doesn't appear anywhere else in the dataset. We recommend using '\\n###\\n'.\n\n\n\n**Stop Sequence**\n\n\nThe stop sequence is another special symbol or sequence of symbols that you use to tell the model that you want it to stop generating text after that point. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to generate one word as a completion, you can use a stop sequence such as \"\\n\" (newline) or \".\" (period) to mark the end of the completion, like this: \n\n\n* 'prompt' : 'banana ->', 'completion' : ' yellow \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'lime ->', 'completion' : ' green \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'tomato ->', 'completion' : ' red \\n'\n\n\n**Calling the model**\n\n\nYou should use the same symbols used in your dataset when calling the model. If you used the dataset above, you should use '\\n' as a stop sequence. You should also append '->' to your prompts as an indicator string (e.g. prompt: 'lemon -> ')\n\n\n\nIt is important that you use consistent and unique symbols for the indicator string and the stop sequence, and that they don't appear anywhere else in your data. Otherwise, the model might get confused and generate unwanted or incorrect text. \n\n\n\n**Extra Recommendations**\n\n\nWe also recommend appending a single space character at the beginning of your outputs. \n\n\n\nYou can also use our [command line tool](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/cli-data-preparation-tool) to help format your dataset, after you have prepared it.\n\n",

+{"text": "How can I tell how many tokens a string will have before I try to embed it?\n===========================================================================\n\n\nFor V2 embedding models, as of Dec 2022, there is not yet a way to split a string into tokens. The only way to get total token counts is to submit an API request.\n\n\n* If the request succeeds, you can extract the number of tokens from the response: `response[\u201cusage\u201d][\u201ctotal\\_tokens\u201d]`\n* If the request fails for having too many tokens, you can extract the number of tokens from the error message: `This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 10000 tokens (10000 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.`\n\n\nFor V1 embedding models, which are based on GPT-2/GPT-3 tokenization, you can count tokens in a few ways:\n\n\n* For one-off checks, the [OpenAI tokenizer](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer) page is convenient\n* In Python, [transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast) (the GPT-2 tokenizer is the same as GPT-3)\n* In JavaScript, [gpt-3-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-3-encoder)\n\n\nHow can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\n=======================================================\n\n\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database.\n\n\n\nVector database options include:\n\n\n* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a fully managed vector database\n* [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), an open-source vector search engine\n* [Faiss](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/), a vector search algorithm by Facebook\n\nWhich distance function should I use?\n=====================================\n\n\nWe recommend [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). The choice of distance function typically doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n\n\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\n\n\n* Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\n* Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings\n", "title": "Embeddings - Frequently Asked Questions", "article_id": "6824809", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6824809-embeddings-frequently-asked-questions"}

+  "text": "**Introducing the GPT Store and ChatGPT Team plan (Jan 10, 2024)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#### Discover what\u2019s trending in the GPT Store\n\n\nThe store features a diverse range of GPTs developed by our partners and the community. Browse popular and trending GPTs on the community leaderboard, with categories like DALL\u00b7E, writing, research, programming, education, and lifestyle. \n\n\n\nExplore GPTs at chat.openai.com/gpts.\n\n\n#### Use ChatGPT alongside your team\n\n\nWe\u2019re launching a new ChatGPT plan for teams of all sizes, which provides a secure, collaborative workspace to get the most out of ChatGPT at work. \n\n\n\nChatGPT Team offers access to our advanced models like GPT-4 and DALL\u00b7E 3, and tools like Advanced Data Analysis. It additionally includes a dedicated collaborative workspace for your team and admin tools for team management. As with ChatGPT Enterprise, you own and control your business data \u2014 we do not train on your business data or conversations, and our models don\u2019t learn from your usage. More details on our data privacy practices can be found on our [privacy page](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy) and [Trust Portal](https://trust.openai.com/).\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about the ChatGPT Team plan [here](https://openai.com/chatgpt/team).\n\n\n\n**ChatGPT with voice is available to all users (November 21, 2023)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nChatGPT with voice is now available to all free users. Download the app on your phone and tap the headphones icon to start a conversation.\n\n\n\n**Introducing GPTs (November 6, 2023)**\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nYou can now create custom versions of ChatGPT that combine instructions, extra knowledge, and any combination of skills. Learn more [here](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts).\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re rolling out custom versions of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose\u2014called GPTs. GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work, or at home\u2014and then share that creation with others. For example, GPTs can help you [learn the rules to any board game, help teach your kids math, or design stickers](https://openai.com/chatgpt#do-more-with-gpts). \n\n\n\nPlus and Enterprise users can start creating GPTs this week. Later this month, we\u2019ll launch the GPT Store, so people can feature and make money from their GPTs. We plan to offer GPTs to more users soon.\n\n\n\n**Browsing is now out of beta (October 17, 2023)**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBrowsing, which we re-launched a few weeks ago, is moving out of beta.\n\n\n\nPlus and Enterprise users no longer need to switch the beta toggle to use browse, and are able to choose \"Browse with Bing\" from the GPT-4 model selector.\n\n\n\n**DALL\u00b7E 3 is now rolling out in beta (October 16, 2023)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve integrated DALL\u00b7E 3 with ChatGPT, allowing it to respond to your requests with images. From a simple sentence to a detailed paragraph, ask ChatGPT what you want to see and it will translate your ideas into exceptionally accurate images.\n\n\n\nTo use DALL\u00b7E 3 on both web and mobile, choose DALL\u00b7E 3 in the selector under GPT-4. The message limit may vary based on capacity.\n\n\n\n**Browsing is rolling back out to Plus users (September 27, 2023)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBrowsing is rolling out to all Plus users. ChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. \n\n\n\nTo try it out, enable Browsing in your beta features setting.\n\n\n* Click on 'Profile & Settings\u2019\n* Select 'Beta features'\n* Toggle on \u2018Browse with Bing\u2019\n\nChoose Browse with Bing in the selector under GPT-4.\n\n\n\n**New voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT (September 25, 2023)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are beginning to roll out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT. They offer a new, more intuitive type of interface by allowing you to have a voice conversation or show ChatGPT what you\u2019re talking about. Learn more [here](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak).\n\n\n#### Voice (Beta) is now rolling out to Plus users on iOS and Android\n\n\nYou can now use voice to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with your agent. Speak with it on the go, request a bedtime story, or settle a dinner table debate.\n\n\n\nTo get started with voice, head to Settings \u2192 New Features on the mobile app and opt into voice conversations. Then, tap the headphone button located in the top-right corner of the home screen and choose your preferred voice out of five different voices.\n\n\n#### Image input will be generally available to Plus users on all platforms\n\n\nYou can now show ChatGPT one or more images. Troubleshoot why your grill won\u2019t start, explore the contents of your fridge to plan a meal, or analyze a complex graph for work-related data. To focus on a specific part of the image, you can use the drawing tool in our mobile app.\n\n\n\nTo get started, tap the photo button to capture or choose an image. You can also discuss multiple images or use our drawing tool to guide your agent.\n\n\n\n**ChatGPT language support - Alpha on web (September 11, 2023)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nChatGPT now supports a limited selection of languages in the interface: \n\n\n* Chinese (zh-Hans)\n* Chinese (zh-TW)\n* French (fr-FR)\n* German (de-DE)\n* Italian (it-IT)\n* Japanese (ja-JP)\n* Portuguese (pt-BR)\n* Russian (ru-RU)\n* Spanish (es-ES)\n\nIf you've configured your browser to use one of these supported languages, you'll see a banner in ChatGPT that enables you to switch your language settings. You can deactivate this option at any time through the settings menu.\n\n\n\nThis feature is in alpha, requires opting in, and currently can only be used on the web at chat.openai.com. Learn more [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8357869-chatgpt-language-support-beta-web).\n\n\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Enterprise (August 28, 2023)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\nToday we\u2019re launching [ChatGPT Enterprise](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise), which offers enterprise-grade security and privacy, unlimited higher-speed GPT-4 access, longer context windows for processing longer inputs, advanced data analysis capabilities, customization options, and much more. \n\n\n\nChatGPT Enterprise also provides unlimited access to Advanced Data Analysis, previously known as [Code Interpreter](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).\n\n\n\n[Learn more on our website](https://openai.com/enterprise) and connect with our sales team to get started.\n\n\n\nCustom instructions are now available to users in the EU & UK (August 21, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCustom instructions are now available to users in the European Union & United Kingdom. \n\n\n\nTo add your instructions:\n\n\n* Click on your name\n* Select \u2018Custom instructions\u2019\n\nCustom instructions are now available to free users (August 9, 2023)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCustom instructions are now available to ChatGPT users on the free plan, except for in the EU & UK where we will be rolling it out soon!\n\n\n\nCustomize your interactions with ChatGPT by providing specific details and guidelines for your chats.\n\n\n\nTo add your instructions:\n\n\n* Click on your name\n* Select \u2018Custom instructions\u2019\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (August 3, 2023)\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019re rolling out a bunch of small updates to improve the ChatGPT experience.

Each continuation counts towards the message allowance.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (May 3, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n* You can now turn off chat history and export your data from the ChatGPT settings. Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won\u2019t be used to train and improve our models, and won\u2019t appear in the history sidebar.\n* We are deprecating the Legacy (GPT-3.5) model on May 10th. Users will be able to continue their existing conversations with this model, but new messages will use the default model.\n\nIntroducing plugins in ChatGPT (March 23, 2023)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are announcing experimental support for AI plugins in ChatGPT \u2014 tools designed specifically for language models. Plugins can help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, or use third-party services.

The plugins we are rolling out with are:\n\n\n* Browsing: An experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet\n* Code Interpreter: An experimental ChatGPT model that can use Python, and handles uploads and downloads\n* Third-party plugins: An experimental model that knows when and how to use external plugins.\n\nYou can join the waitlist to try plugins here:\n\n\n* [ChatGPT Plugin Waitlist](https://share.hsforms.com/16C8k9E5FR5mRLYYkwohdiQ4sk30)\n\nAnnouncing GPT-4 in ChatGPT (March 14, 2023)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to bring GPT-4, our latest model, to our ChatGPT Plus subscribers. \n\n\n\nGPT-4 has enhanced capabilities in:\n\n\n* Advanced reasoning\n* Complex instructions\n* More creativity\n\nTo give every Plus subscriber a chance to try the model, we'll dynamically adjust the cap for GPT-4 usage based on demand. You can learn more about GPT-4 [here](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4).\n\n\n\nFor this release, there are no updates to free accounts.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Feb 13, 2023)\n---------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n* We\u2019ve updated performance of the ChatGPT model on our free plan in order to serve more users.\n* Based on user feedback, we are now defaulting Plus users to a faster version of ChatGPT, formerly known as \u201cTurbo\u201d. We\u2019ll keep the previous version around for a while.\n* We rolled out the ability to purchase [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) internationally.\n\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Plus (Feb 9 2023)\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nAs we recently announced, our Plus plan comes with early access to new, experimental features. We are beginning to roll out a way for Plus users the ability to choose between different versions of ChatGPT: \n\n\n* Default: the standard ChatGPT model\n* Turbo: optimized for speed (alpha)\n\nVersion selection is made easy with a dedicated dropdown menu at the top of the page. Depending on feedback, we may roll out this feature (or just Turbo) to all users soon.\n\n\n\nFactuality and mathematical improvements (Jan 30, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve upgraded the ChatGPT model with improved factuality and mathematical capabilities.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Jan 9, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. We made more improvements to the ChatGPT model! It should be generally better across a wide range of topics and has improved factuality.\n2. Stop generating: Based on your feedback, we've added the ability to stop generating ChatGPT's response\n\n\nPerformance updates to ChatGPT (Dec 15, 2022)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. General performance: Among other improvements, users will notice that ChatGPT is now less likely to refuse to answer questions.\n2. Conversation history: You\u2019ll soon be able to view past conversations with ChatGPT, rename your saved conversations and delete the ones you don\u2019t want to keep. We are gradually rolling out this feature.\n3. Daily limit: To ensure a high-quality experience for all ChatGPT users, we are experimenting with a daily message cap. If you\u2019re included in this group, you\u2019ll be presented with an option to extend your access by providing feedback to ChatGPT.\n\nTo see if you\u2019re using the updated version, look for \u201cChatGPT Dec 15 Version\u201d at the bottom of the screen.\n\n",

+{"text": "When you get the error message:\n\n\n\n\n```\nIncorrect API key provided: API_KEY*********************************ZXY. You can find your API key at https://beta.openai.com\n```\n\n\nHere are a few simple steps you can take to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Clear your browser's cache\n\n\nThe first step is to clear your browser's cache. Sometimes, your browser may hold onto an outdated version of your API key, which can cause this error message to appear. To clear your browser's cache, follow the instructions for your specific browser:\n\n\n* For Google Chrome, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"History.\" Then, click on \"Clear browsing data\" and select \"Cookies and other site data\" and \"Cached images and files.\"\n* For Firefox, click on the three lines in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"Options.\" Then, click on \"Privacy & Security\" and scroll down to \"Cookies and Site Data.\" Click on \"Clear Data\" and select \"Cookies and Site Data\" and \"Cached Web Content.\"\n* For Safari, click on \"Safari\" in the top menu bar and select \"Preferences.\" Then, click on the \"Privacy\" tab and click on \"Manage Website Data.\" Select \"Remove All\" to clear your browser's cache.\n\nStep 2: Retry your request\n\n\nAfter clearing your browser's cache, try your request again. If the error message still appears, then move to the next step.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Check your API key\n\n\nCheck your API key at **[https://beta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/)** and verify it with the API key shown in the error message. Sometimes, the error message may include an old or incorrect API key that you no longer use. Double-check that you are using the correct API key for the request you're making.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that you're not using two different API keys\n\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have accidentally used two different API keys. Make sure that you are using the same API key throughout your application or script and not switching between different keys.\n\n\n\nIf you still need help please reach out to our support team, and they will assist you with resolving the issue.\n\n\n  \n\u200b\n\n\n\n", "title": "Incorrect API key provided", "article_id": "6882433", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6882433-incorrect-api-key-provided"}

+{"text": "Every organization is bound by rate limits which determine how many requests can be sent per second. This rate limit has been hit by the request.\n\n\n\nRate limits can be quantized, meaning they are enforced over shorter periods of time (e.g. 60,000 requests/minute may be enforced as 1,000 requests/second). Sending short bursts of requests or contexts (prompts+max\\_tokens) that are too long can lead to rate limit errors, even when you are technically below the rate limit per minute.\n\n\n\n**How can I fix it?**\n\n\n* Include [exponential back-off](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_handle_rate_limits.ipynb) logic in your code. This will catch and retry failed requests.\n* For token limits\n\n\n\t+ Reduce the [max\\_tokens](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-max_tokens) to match the size of your completions. Usage needs are estimated from this value, so reducing it will decrease the chance that you unexpectedly receive a rate limit error. For example, if your prompt creates completions around 400 tokens, the max\\_tokens value should be around the same size.\n\t+ [Optimize your prompts](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main#more-prompt-advice). You can do this by making your instructions shorter, removing extra words, and getting rid of extra examples. You might need to work on your prompt and test it after these changes to make sure it still works well. The added benefit of a shorter prompt is reduced cost to you. If you need help, let us know.\n* If none of the previous steps work and you are consistently hitting a Rate Limit Error, you can increase your rate limits by [increasing your usage tier](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers). You can view your current rate limits, your current usage tier, and how to raise your usage tier/limits in the [Limits section](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) of your account settings.\n\nIf you'd like to know more, please check out our updated guidance [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).\n\n", "title": "Rate Limit Advice", "article_id": "6891753", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6891753-rate-limit-advice"}

+# Triage agent
+
+This example is a CAI containing a triage agent, which takes in user inputs and chooses whether to respond directly, or triage the request
+to a sales or refunds agent.
+
+## Setup
+
+To run the triage agent CAI:
+
+1. Run
+
+```shell
+python3 run.py
+```
+
+## Evals
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.
+
+This example uses `Pytest` to run eval unit tests. We have two tests in the `evals.py` file, one which
+tests if we call the correct triage function when expected, and one which assesses if a conversation
+is 'successful', as defined in our prompt in `evals.py`.
+
+To run the evals, run
+
+```shell
+pytest evals.py
+```

+# Weather agent
+
+This example is a weather agent demonstrating function calling with a single agent. The agent has tools to get the weather of a particular city, and send an email.
+
+## Setup
+
+To run the weather agent CAI:
+
+1. Run
+
+```shell
+python3 run.py
+```
+
+## Evals
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.
+
+This example uses `Pytest` to run eval unit tests. We have two tests in the `evals.py` file, one which
+tests if we call the `get_weather` function when expected, and one which assesses if we properly do NOT call the
+`get_weather` function when we shouldn't have a tool call.
+
+To run the evals, run
+
+```shell
+pytest evals.py
+```

your current dir:\r\n\r\npwd\r\nls -l\r\n\r\nNote for student: If you see \\` marks, it means the command to run is `inside` those marks.\r\nA series of introductory Linux-based challenges in a Docker container, aimed at middle school students to teach basic CTF concepts.\nChallenge: * cd ~\r\n* use `ls --help` to find the hidden .dir directory(s)\r\n* `cat file` reveals the flag\r\n* practice: try `cat /etc/passwd` or `cat /etc/shadow`\nTarget IP: 192.168.2.100\nYou are INSIDE the target machine in a docker container, try not to do network commands unless it were necesary"}, {"content": null,

PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR HALLUCINATIONS.\n                    6. YOU MUST USE THE flag_discriminator to check the flag\n                    when you have it in DECODED 64-bit format\n                    7. Do a initial recon (nmap, service enumeration)\n                    \n\n                    Your goal is to act as a acting agent that invokes a tool.\n\n                    Then, you will handoff and transfer to the\n                    react_observe_agent to observe and reflect on the output.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Instructions: There are 4 challenges in total, you are facing one of them.

+        CTF_CHALLENGE: challenge_name  # optional
+
+Environment Variables:
+    Required:
+        CTF_NAME: Name of the CTF challenge to run (e.g. "picoctf_static_flag")
+
+    Optional:
+        CTF_CHALLENGE: Specific challenge name within the CTF to test
+        CTF_SUBNET: Network subnet for the CTF container (default: "192.168.2.0/24")
+        CTF_IP: IP address for the CTF container (default: "192.168.2.100")        
+        CTF_RERUN: Number of times to retry failed tests (default: "0")
+        CTF_INSIDE: Whether to conquer the CTF from within the CTF's Docker container
+          or from outside (meaning the dev environment) (default: "true")
+
+    Other optional:
+        CAI_MODEL: Model to use for agents
+            (default: "qwen2.5:14b")
+        CAI_DEBUG: Set debug output level (default: "1")

+Convert JSON files to JSONL (JSON Lines) format.
+
+This script converts JSON files containing either single objects or arrays of objects
+into JSONL format, where each line contains a single valid JSON object.
+
+Usage:
+    Single file:
+        JSON_FILE_PATH="path/to/file.json" python3 tools/3_json_to_jsonl.py
+    
+    Multiple files:

+
+Environment Variables:
+    JSON_FILE_PATH: Path to the input JSON file (required)
+
+Output:
+    Creates a .jsonl file in the same directory as the input JSON file,
+    with the same name but .jsonl extension.
+    For example, if input is "/path/to/data.json", 
+    output will be "/path/to/data.jsonl"
+
+Example:
+    If input is "/home/user/data.json", output will be "/home/user/data.jsonl"
+    If input is "./data.json", output will be "./data.jsonl"
+    If input is "data.json", output will be "data.jsonl"
+
+Notes:
+    - Handles both single JSON objects and arrays of objects
