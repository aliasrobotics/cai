## Motivation
### :bust_in_silhouette: Why CAI?
The cybersecurity landscape is undergoing a dramatic transformation as AI becomes increasingly integrated into security operations. **We predict that by 2028, AI-powered security testing tools will outnumber human pentesters**. This shift represents a fundamental change in how we approach cybersecurity challenges. *AI is not just another tool - it's becoming essential for addressing complex security vulnerabilities and staying ahead of sophisticated threats. As organizations face more advanced cyber attacks, AI-enhanced security testing will be crucial for maintaining robust defenses.*

This work builds upon prior efforts[^4] and similarly, we believe that democratizing access to advanced cybersecurity AI tools is vital for the entire security community. That's why we're releasing Cybersecurity AI (`CAI`) as an open source framework. Our goal is to empower security researchers, ethical hackers, and organizations to build and deploy powerful AI-driven security tools. By making these capabilities openly available, we aim to level the playing field and ensure that cutting-edge security AI technology isn't limited to well-funded private companies or state actors.

Bug Bounty programs have become a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, providing a crucial mechanism for organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities in their systems before they can be exploited. These programs have proven highly effective at securing both public and private infrastructure, with researchers discovering critical vulnerabilities that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. CAI is specifically designed to enhance these efforts by providing a lightweight, ergonomic framework for building specialized AI agents that can assist in various aspects of Bug Bounty hunting - from initial reconnaissance to vulnerability validation and reporting. Our framework aims to augment human expertise with AI capabilities, helping researchers work more efficiently and thoroughly in their quest to make digital systems more secure.

### Ethical principles behind CAI

You might be wondering if releasing CAI *in-the-wild* given its capabilities and security implications is ethical. Our decision to open-source this framework is guided by two core ethical principles:

1. **Democratizing Cybersecurity AI**: We believe that advanced cybersecurity AI tools should be accessible to the entire security community, not just well-funded private companies or state actors. By releasing CAI as an open source framework, we aim to empower security researchers, ethical hackers, and organizations to build and deploy powerful AI-driven security tools, leveling the playing field in cybersecurity.

2. **Transparency in AI Security Capabilities**: Based on our research results, understanding of the technology, and dissection of top technical reports, we argue that current LLM vendors are undermining their cybersecurity capabilities. This is extremely dangerous and misleading. By developing CAI openly, we provide a transparent benchmark of what AI systems can actually do in cybersecurity contexts, enabling more informed decisions about security postures.

CAI is built on the following core principles:
- **Cybersecurity oriented AI framework**: CAI is specifically designed for cybersecurity use cases, aiming at semi- and fully-automating offensive and defensive security tasks.
- **Open source, free for research**: CAI is open source and free for research purposes. We aim at democratizing access to AI and Cybersecurity. For professional or commercial use, including on-premise deployments, dedicated technical support and custom extensions [reach out](mailto:research@aliasrobotics.com) to obtain a license.
- **Lightweight**: CAI is designed to be fast, and easy to use.
- **Modular and agent-centric design**: CAI operates on the basis of agents and agentic patterns, which allows flexibility and scalability. You can easily add the most suitable agents and pattern for your cybersecuritytarget case.
- **Tool-integration**: CAI integrates already built-in tools, and allows the user to integrate their own tools with their own logic easily.
- **Logging and tracing integrated**: using [`phoenix`](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix), the open source tracing and logging tool for LLMs. This provides the user with a detailed traceability of the agents and their execution.
- **Multi-Model Support**: more than 300 supported and empowered by [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm). The most popular providers:
  - **Anthropic**: `Claude 3.7`, `Claude 3.5`, `Claude 3`, `Claude 3 Opus`
  - **OpenAI**: `O1`, `O1 Mini`, `O3 Mini`, `GPT-4o`, `GPT-4.5 Preview`
  - **DeepSeek**: `DeepSeek V3`, `DeepSeek R1`
  - **Ollama**: `Qwen2.5 72B`, `Qwen2.5 14B`, etc



## :nut_and_bolt: Install


:warning: :warning: **Discouraged for now**, refer to the [Development](#development) section for dev. install instructions.

```shell
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/aliasrobotics/alias_research/cai.git  # requires Python 3.10+
```


## :triangular_ruler: Architecture:

CAI focuses on making cybersecurity agent **coordination** and **execution** lightweight, highly controllable, and useful for humans. To do so it builds upon 7 pillars: `Agent`s, `Tools`, `Handoffs`, `Patterns`, `Turns`, `Tracing` and `HITL`.

### 🔹 Agent

At its core, CAI abstracts its cybersecurity behavior via `Agents` and agentic `Patterns`. An Agent in *an intelligent system that interacts with some environment*. More technically, within CAI we embrace a robotics-centric definition wherein an agent is anything that can be viewed as a system perceiving its environment through sensors, reasoning about its goals and and acting accordingly upon that environment through actuators (*adapted* from Russel & Norvig, AI: A Modern Approach). In cybersecurity, an `Agent` interacts with systems and networks, using peripherals and network interfaces as sensors, reasons accordingly and then executes network actions as if actuators. Correspondingly, in CAI, `Agent`s implement the `ReACT` (Reasoning and Action) agent model[^3].


```python
from cai.types import Agent
from cai.core import CAI
ctf_agent = Agent(
    name="CTF Agent",
    instructions="""You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader facing a CTF
                    challenge.
                    INSTRUCTIONS:
                    1. Execute the generic_linux_command tool without any
                    explanation.
                    2. Be efficient and strategic when executing commands.
                    3. Never assume the flag format - it could be any string
                    """,
    model= "gpt-4o",
)

messages = [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "CTF challenge: TryMyNetwork. Target IP: 192.168.1.1"
   }]

client = CAI()
response = client.run(agent=ctf_agent,
                      messages=messages)
```

### 🔹 Tools

`Tools` let cybersecurity agents take actions by providing interfaces to execute system commands, run security scans, analyze vulnerabilities, and interact with target systems and APIs - they are the core capabilities that enable CAI agents to perform security tasks effectively; in CAI, tools include built-in cybersecurity utilities (like LinuxCmd for command execution, WebSearch for OSINT gathering, Code for dynamic script execution, and SSHTunnel for secure remote access), function calling mechanisms that allow integration of any Python function as a security tool, and agent-as-tool functionality that enables specialized security agents (such as reconnaissance or exploit agents) to be used by other agents, creating powerful collaborative security workflows without requiring formal handoffs between agents.

```python
from cai.types import Agent
from cai.tools.common import run_command
from cai.core import CAI

def listing_tool():
   """
   This is a tool used list the files in the current directory
   """
    command = "ls -la"
    return run_command(command, ctf=ctf)

def generic_linux_command(command: str = "", args: str = "", ctf=None) -> str:
    """
    Tool to send a linux command.
    """
    command = f'{command} {args}'
    return run_command(command, ctf=ctf)

ctf_agent = Agent(
    name="CTF Agent",
    instructions="""You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader facing a CTF
                    challenge.
                    INSTRUCTIONS:
                    1. Execute the generic_linux_command tool without any
                    explanation.
                    2. YOU MUST USE THE flag_discriminator function to check the flag""",
    model= "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    functions=[listing_tool, generic_linux_command])

client = CAI()
messages = [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "CTF challenge: TryMyNetwork. Target IP: 192.168.1.1"
   }]

response = client.run(agent=ctf_agent,
                      messages=messages)
```


You may find different [tools](cai/tools). They are grouped in 6 major categories inspired by the security kill chain [^2]:

1. Reconnaissance and weaponization - *reconnaissance*  (crypto, listing, etc)
2. Exploitation - *exploitation*
3. Privilege escalation - *escalation*
4. Lateral movement - *lateral*
5. Data exfiltration - *exfiltration*
6. Command and control - *control*


### 🔹 Handoffs

`Handoffs` allow an `Agent` to delegate tasks to another agent, which is crucial in cybersecurity operations where specialized expertise is needed for different phases of an engagement. In our framework, `Handoffs` are implemented as tools for the LLM, where a **handoff/transfer function** like `transfer_to_flag_discriminator` enables the `ctf_agent` to pass control to the `flag_discriminator_agent` once it believes it has found the flag. This creates a security validation chain where the first agent handles exploitation and flag discovery, while the second agent specializes in flag verification, ensuring proper segregation of duties and leveraging specialized capabilities of different models for distinct security tasks.


```python
from cai.types import Agent
from cai.core import CAI

ctf_agent = Agent(
    name="CTF Agent",
    instructions="""You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader facing a CTF
                    challenge.
                    INSTRUCTIONS:
                    1. Execute the generic_linux_command tool without any
                    explanation.
                    2. YOU MUST USE THE flag_discriminator function to check the flag""",
    model= "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
    functions=[],
)

flag_discriminator_agent = Agent(
    name="Flag Discriminator Agent",
    instructions="You are a Cybersecurity expert facing a CTF challenge. You are in charge of checking if the flag is correct.",
    model= "qwen2.5:14b",
    functions=[],
)

def transfer_to_flag_discriminator():
    """
    Transfer the flag to the flag_discriminator_agent to check if it is the correct flag
    """
    return flag_discriminator_agent

ctf_agent.functions.append(transfer_to_flag_discriminator)

client = CAI()
messages = [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "CTF challenge: TryMyNetwork. Target IP: 192.168.1.1"
   }]

response = client.run(agent=ctf_agent,
                      messages=messages)
```

### 🔹 Patterns

An agentic `Pattern` is a *structured design paradigm* in artificial intelligence systems where autonomous or semi-autonomous agents operate within a defined *interaction framework* (the pattern) to achieve a goal. These `Patterns` specify the organization, coordination, and communication
methods among agents, guiding decision-making, task execution, and delegation.

An agentic pattern (`AP`) can be formally defined as a tuple:

\\[
AP = (A, H, D, C, E)
\\]

wherein:

- **\\(A\\) (Agents):** A set of autonomous entities, \\( A = \\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\} \\), each with defined roles, capabilities, and internal states.
- **\\(H\\) (Handoffs):** A function \\( H: A \times T \to A \\) that governs how tasks \\( T \\) are transferred between agents based on predefined logic (e.g., rules, negotiation, bidding).
- **\\(D\\) (Decision Mechanism):** A decision function \\( D: S \to A \\) where \\( S \\) represents system states, and \\( D \\) determines which agent takes action at any given time.
- **\\(C\\) (Communication Protocol):** A messaging function \\( C: A \times A \to M \\), where \\( M \\) is a message space, defining how agents share information.
- **\\(E\\) (Execution Model):** A function \\( E: A \times I \to O \\) where \\( I \\) is the input space and \\( O \\) is the output space, defining how agents perform tasks.

When building `Patterns`, we generall y classify them among one of the following categories, though others exist:

| **Agentic** `Pattern` **categories** | **Description** |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| `Swarm` (Decentralized) | Agents share tasks and self-assign responsibilities without a central orchestrator. Handoffs occur dynamically. *An example of a peer-to-peer agentic pattern is the `CTF Agentic Pattern`, which involves a team of agents working together to solve a CTF challenge with dynamic handoffs.* |
| `Hierarchical` | A top-level agent (e.g., "PlannerAgent") assigns tasks via structured handoffs to specialized sub-agents. Alternatively, the structure of the agents is harcoded into the agentic pattern with pre-defined handoffs. |
| `Chain-of-Thought` (Sequential Workflow) | A structured pipeline where Agent A produces an output, hands it to Agent B for reuse or refinement, and so on. Handoffs follow a linear sequence. *An example of a chain-of-thought agentic pattern is the `ReasonerAgent`, which involves a Reasoning-type LLM that provides context to the main agent to solve a CTF challenge with a linear sequence.*[^1] |
| `Auction-Based` (Competitive Allocation) | Agents "bid" on tasks based on priority, capability, or cost. A decision agent evaluates bids and hands off tasks to the best-fit agent. |
| `Recursive` | A single agent continuously refines its own output, treating itself as both executor and evaluator, with handoffs (internal or external) to itself. *An example of a recursive agentic pattern is the `CodeAgent` (when used as a recursive agent), which continuously refines its own output by executing code and updating its own instructions.* |

Building a `Pattern` is rather straightforward and only requires to link together `Agents`, `Tools` and `Handoffs`. For example, the following builds an offensive `Pattern` that adopts the `Swarm` category:

```python
# A Swarm Pattern for Red Team Operations
from cai.agents.red_teamer import redteam_agent
from cai.agents.thought import thought_agent
from cai.agents.mail import dns_smtp_agent


def transfer_to_dns_agent():
    """
    Use THIS always for DNS scans and domain reconnaissance about dmarc and dkim registers
    """
    return dns_smtp_agent


def redteam_agent_handoff(ctf=None):
    """
    Red Team Agent, call this function empty to transfer to redteam_agent
    """
    return redteam_agent


def thought_agent_handoff(ctf=None):
    """
    Thought Agent, call this function empty to transfer to thought_agent
    """
    return thought_agent

# Register handoff functions to enable inter-agent communication pathways
redteam_agent.functions.append(transfer_to_dns_agent)
dns_smtp_agent.functions.append(redteam_agent_handoff)
thought_agent.functions.append(redteam_agent_handoff)

# Initialize the swarm pattern with the thought agent as the entry point
redteam_swarm_pattern = thought_agent
redteam_swarm_pattern.pattern = "swarm"
```

### 🔹 Turns and Interactions
During the agentic flow (conversation), we distinguish between **interactions** and **turns**.

- **Interactions** are sequential exchanges between one or multiple agents. Each agent executing its logic corresponds with one *interaction*. Since an `Agent` in CAI generally implements the `ReACT` agent model[^3], each *interaction* consists of 1) a reasoning step via an LLM inference and 2) act by calling zero-to-n `Tools`. This is defined in`process_interaction()` in [core.py](cai/core.py).
- **Turns**: A turn represents a cycle of one ore more **interactions** which finishes when the `Agent` (or `Pattern`) executing returns `None`, judging there're no further actions to undertake. This is defined in `run()`, see [core.py](cai/core.py).


> [!NOTE]
> CAI Agents are not related to Assistants in the Assistants API. They are named similarly for convenience, but are otherwise completely unrelated. CAI is entirely powered by the Chat Completions API and is hence stateless between calls.


### 🔹 Tracing

CAI implements AI observability by adopting the OpenTelemetry standard and to do so, it leverages [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) which provides comprehensive tracing capabilities through OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation, allowing you to monitor and analyze your security operations in real-time. This integration enables detailed visibility into agent interactions, tool usage, and attack vectors throughout penetration testing workflows, making it easier to debug complex exploitation chains, track vulnerability discovery processes, and optimize agent performance for more effective security assessments.

```

CAI delivers a framework for building Cybersecurity AIs with a strong emphasis on *semi-autonomous* operation, as the reality is that **fully-autonomous** cybersecurity systems remain premature and face significant challenges when tackling complex tasks. While CAI explores autonomous capabilities, we recognize that effective security operations still require human teleoperation providing expertise, judgment, and oversight in the security process.

Accordingly, the Human-In-The-Loop (`HITL`) module is a core design principle of CAI, acknowledging that human intervention and teleoperation are essential components of responsible security testing. Through the `cli.py` interface, users can seamlessly interact with agents at any point during execution by simply pressing `Ctrl+C`. This is implemented across [core.py](cai/core.py) and also in the REPL abstractions [REPL](cai/repl).

CAI>

IP: 192.168.2.5 | OS: Linux 6.10.14-linuxkit | Ollama: 61 models | Model: default | Max Turns: inf | 08:44 UTC
```

That should initialize CAI and provide a prompt to execute any security task you want to perform. The navigation bar at the bottom displays important system information. This information helps you understand your environment while working with CAI.

From here on, type on `CAI` and start your security exercise. Best way to learn is by example:



### Environment Variables
For using private models, you are given a [`.env.example`](.env.example) file. Copy it and rename it as `.env`. Fill in your corresponding API keys, and you are ready to use CAI.

<details><summary>If host networking is not working with ollama check whether it has been disabled in Docker because you are not signed in</summary>

Docker in OS X behaves funny sometimes. Check if the following message has shown up:

*Host networking has been disabled because you are not signed in. Please sign in to enable it*.

Make sure this has been addressed and also that the Dev Container is not forwarding the 8000 port (click on x, if necessary in the ports section).

To verify connection, from within the VSCode devcontainer:
```bash
curl -v http://host.docker.internal:8000/api/version
```

<summary>Run CAI against any target</summary>

![cai-004-first-message](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-004-first-message.png)

The starting user prompt in this case is: `Target IP: 192.168.2.10, perform a full network scan`.

The agent started performing a nmap scan. You could either interact with the agent and give it more instructions, or let it run to see what it explores next.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I interact with the agent? Type twice CTRL + C </summary>

![cai-005-ctrl-c](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-005-ctrl-c.png)

If you want to use the HITL mode, you can do it by presssing twice ```Ctrl + C```.
This will allow you to interact (prompt) with the agent whenever you want. The agent will not lose the previous context, as it is stored in the `history` variable, which is passed to it and any agent that is called. This enables any agent to use the previous information and be more accurate and efficient.
</details>

<details>
<summary> Can I change the model while CAI is running? /model </summary>

Use ```/model``` to change the model.

<details>
<summary>How can I trace the whole execution?</summary>
The environment variable `CAI_TRACING` allows the user to set it to `CAI_TRACING=true` to enable tracing, or `CAI_TRACING=false` to disable it.
When CAI is prompted by the first time, the user is provided with two paths, the execution log, and the tracing log.

![cai-009-logs](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-009-logs.png)

</details>


<details>
<summary>Can I expand CAI capabilities using previous run logs?</summary>

Absolutely! The **memory extension** allows you to use a previously sucessful runs ( the log object is stored as a **.jsonl file in the [log](cai/logs) folder** ) in a new run against the same target.
The user is also given the path highlighted in orange as shown below.

![cai-009-logs](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-009-logs.png)

How to make use of this functionality?

1. Run CAI against the target. Let's assume the target name is: `target001`.
2. Get the log file path, something like: ```logs/cai_20250408_111856.jsonl```
3. Generate the memory using any model of your preference:
```shell JSONL_FILE_PATH="logs/cai_20250408_111856.jsonl" CTF_INSIDE="false" CAI_MEMORY_COLLECTION="target001" CAI_MEMORY="episodic" CAI_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" python3 tools/2_jsonl_to_memory.py ```

The script [`tools/2_jsonl_to_memory.py`](cai/tools/2_jsonl_to_memory.py) will generate a memory collection file with the most relevant steps. The quality of the memory collection will depend on the model you use.

4. Use the generated memory collection and execute a new run:
```shell CAI_MEMORY="episodic" CAI_MODEL="gpt-4o" CAI_MEMORY_COLLECTION="target001" CAI_TRACING=false python3 cai/cli.py```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I expand CAI capabilities using scripts or extra information?</summary>

Currently, CAI supports text based information. You can add any extra information on the target you are facing by copy-pasting it directly into the system or user prompt.

**How?** By adding it to the system ([`system_master_template.md`](cai/repl/templates/system_master_template.md)) or the user prompt ([`user_master_template.md`](cai/repl/templates/user_master_template.md)). You can always directly prompt the path to the model, and it will ```cat``` it.
