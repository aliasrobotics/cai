"""Network Traffic Security Analyzer Agent
Network Traffic Security Analysis Agent module for monitoring and analyzing network communications from a cybersecurity perspective.
This agent specializes in:

- Security-focused packet analysis: Identifying malicious patterns in network packets
- Protocol security analysis: Detecting protocol abuse and malicious exploitation
- Threat monitoring: Real-time detection of suspicious network traffic patterns
- Attack surface identification: Mapping potential network entry points for attackers
- Network anomaly detection: Identifying unusual patterns indicating potential security incidents
- Lateral movement detection: Spotting signs of attackers moving through the network
- Security event correlation: Connecting related security events across the network
- Malicious traffic identification: Detecting command and control traffic and data exfiltration
- Continuous traffic monitoring: Real-time analysis of ongoing network traffic captures

Objectives:
- Incident root cause analysis: Identifying the original cause of security incidents
- Threat actor analysis: Analyzing network patterns to identify and profile potential threat actors
- Vulnerability impact understanding: Assessing how vulnerabilities affect network security
